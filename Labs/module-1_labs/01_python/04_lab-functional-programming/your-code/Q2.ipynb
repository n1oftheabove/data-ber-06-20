    "Now we want to enhance the `get_bow_from_docs` function so that it will work with HTML webpages. In HTML, there are a lot of messy codes such as HTML tags, Javascripts, [unicodes](https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_utf_misc_symbols.asp) that will mess up your bag of words. We need to clean up those junk before generating BoW.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, what you will do is to define several new functions each of which is specialized to clean up the HTML codes in one aspect. For instance, you can have a `strip_html_tags` function to remove all HTML tags, a `remove_punctuation` function to remove all punctuation, a `to_lower_case` function to convert string to lowercase, and a `remove_unicode` function to remove all unicodes.\n",

      "The instructor for our Cohort Nick was very knowledgeable The only downside was that it was his first time teaching the course so it felt like he was also learning as we were all trying to learn something too Besides that he was most definitely a great instructor and without his proficiency on the subject I would not have learned as much as I did As for the teaching assistants all three of them were amazing Sandra Marcos Ian They were all very familiar with the coursework since they were all Ironhack graduates as well It was extremely helpful having dedicated TAs who were former students helping us because they know the struggle so they WANT to help Theres more than enough help to go around just make sure to ASK for it when you need it and you wont fall behind\n",
      "\n",
      "The coursework definitely needed some tweaking on some days our instructor Nick pushed aside what he felt was wrong and obsolete and taught it the best way he could and it definitely worked out During the course this was one of my top issues the curriculum for sure needed an update but from what I have seen after my time there they are or already have taken the steps necessary to do so Which means they take your feedback seriously and wont brush your input aside\n",

      "I was also very impressed with the professor Alan He is an extremely knowledgeable person with a natural aptitude for teaching Always patient courteous and welcoming of questions feedback and taking time to ask us if we all understood or were running into any problems What really impressed me most about Alan is how he would take a little bit of time at the start of each class to go beyond the curriculum and to challenge us with computer science coding challenges to prepare us to think like computer scientists and get us ready for the types of questions we would likely see in a coding interview and explain the different ways to approach the problems and how to think about them in terms of time complexity or memory management It was well beyond what I expected from a web development course and I found these lessons particularly rewarding Alan has a knack for breaking down complex and abstract concepts into digestible bits and getting the class comfortable enough to try and collectively attempt a solution Protip Always volunteer to try and solve the problems he presents I noticed the students brave enough to attempt these problems retained information better and walked away with a more solid understanding If he gives you the marker get up there and give it your best effort Go home and research the concepts further JUST DO IT  Get a whiteboard for your house and write important concepts objectives goals and problem examples from class This will force your brain to reconcile this new information on a daily basis You will almost certainly see these types of coding challenges in job interviews and theyre abstract and frustrating if you are not prepared\n",

      "After graduation youll be counseled by Brito your career counselor who is also a very cool downtoearth and knowledgeable person He has some real wisdom to share about the interviewing process how to construct your resume and specifically tells you to reach out to him before accepting any job offers I am really impressed with his insight and willingness to be supportive helpful and make sure you land a good starting job well after graduation \n",

      "The hours were very intense Officially the hours are am to pm like a fulltime job but I don’t remember many days when we actually finished at  If you’re at Ironhack then it’s in your best interest to get as much out of the program as you can\n",
      "\n",
      "The teaching was also quite intense I’m  now so I had been out of school for many years and going back to lectures was a lot more demanding than I thought it would be But as intense as it was it was also very satisfying Your character really shows when you’re learning web development – you have to deal with daily frustrations and a lot of challenges but overcoming those challenges is really rewarding\n",

      "Can you tell me about Everis and what you work on there\n",
      "\n",

      "It’s a huge company I think there are about  people in Barcelona and they have branches around the world The company is very diverse and the teams are very diverse as well They have an emphasis on hiring very genderbalanced teams which is nice Everis is definitely more genderbalanced than other companies\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you using the technologies and programming languages at Everis that you learned at Ironhack\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m working in Angular which is a framework we covered in the third module of Ironhack There are always new things to learn in Angular because Angular is quite complex and always evolving So I haven’t learned any new languages or frameworks but I had to learn more about Angular on the job\n",
      "\n",
      "Ironhack provided us with the tools to be able to teach ourselves new technologies more easily In the future I will inevitably need to learn more languages and frameworks But now I have the right tools to be able to teach myself a lot more easily than before the bootcamp\n",
      "\n",
      "Since you joined Everis how do you feel you’ve grown as a frontend developer\n",
      "\n",
      "In  months I feel like I’ve become a lot more independent and I’m less afraid of touching the code In addition I’ve developed a passion for problems As weird as that sounds I enjoy running into problems because I enjoy solving them It’s very fulfilling Honestly I think Ironhack is the best decision I’ve made in my life in terms of academia and career development I haven’t regretted it once\n",
      "\n",
      "How has your background in graphic design finance and entrepreneurship been useful in your new job as a Front End Developer\n",
      "\n",
      "Graphic design is very much about trends and it’s been a long time since I studied it While there are some aspects of design that still apply a lot has changed At Everis when we get a new project a lot of the design is given by the client – my job is more about implementing the logic and functions rather than the design itself\n",
      "\n",
      "My experience working in finance has definitely been useful at Everis Having experience in a huge corporation definitely helps you work with other people and clients in a professional environment\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s been the biggest challenge or roadblock in your journey to becoming a Front End Developer\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes you can get stuck on a problem for a really long time and you start having to deal with your own frustrations The more you get frustrated the more you block your brain and the less you can really think logically That’s a challenge that I’ve had to learn to deal with and I’m really learning how to be calm and patient I wasn’t a patient person before and I’m now really seeing the results of patience\n",
      "\n",
      "It sounds like Ironhack has stayed involved in your career – have you kept in touch with other alumni\n",
      "\n",
      "I was just at Ironhack last week actually and I’m going again soon A lot of people from my cohort have left but I’ve gotten to know people from the cohorts before and after mine and we’ve become quite tight It’s a very strong community Whenever Ironhack hosts events I prioritize them – it’s a very good atmosphere and a great network and every time I go there I feel like I’m at home\n",
      "\n",
      "What advice do you have for people making a career change through a coding bootcamp\n",
      "\n",
      "Just do it My best advice is to stay calm and be aware that you’re going to reach your mental limits You’re going to have a hard time but it’s really worth it and it’s very rewarding There are going to be times when you’ll want to feel very stupid – don’t If you can be a master of your emotions then you have a good path ahead\n",

      "Whats your background and how did you get involved with Ironhack\n",
      "\n",
      "My background is in strategy consulting I studied business in London and then I worked in strategic consulting for tech startups in Spain and California I worked for the Embassy of Spain in Los Angeles for a little while and then I launched my own venture there\n",
      "\n",
      "Im actually an Ironhack graduate Working in the tech industry I had always been interested in learning how to code So I did some research online and I found Ironhack I graduated from Ironhack around a year and a half ago\n",
      "\n",
      "I fell in love with the company’s mission and the community they were creating You hear some really incredible stories when youre working with people from such diverse backgrounds After graduating I kept in touch with Gonzalo Manrique one of the cofounders so when they decided to expand in Europe he contacted me about the EMEA Europe Middle Eastern and Africa Expansion Lead position It was a nobrainer for me\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you attend Ironhack to become a developer or did you just want to pick up coding skills\n",
      "\n",
      "I wanted to pick up coding skills I think everybody in the future should become literate in some kind of coding language even if you’re not planning on working as a developer Most jobs in the future will require a basic knowledge of programming and I wanted to stay ahead of the curve If you work in tech understanding how software is built is a must regardless of your position Eventually machines will dominate the world and you’ll have to speak their language\n",
      "\n",
      "You have this unique perspective of actually being a student before working as staff at Ironhack\n",
      "\n",
      "Absolutely Its easier for me to explain the benefits behind Ironhack because Ive lived through the whole experience Its really great when we do events and prospective students ask me about Ironhack The first thing I tell them is Look Im an alum I went through the whole experience I can tell you everything you need to know and everything youll go through It was definitely one of the most challenging and rewarding times in my life\n",
      "\n",
      "Tell us about your role at Ironhack\n",
      "\n",
      "The first step when I started was working with the cofounders and the VP of Ops amp Expansion Alex Berriche to make a strategy plan for Europe We had various cities in mind and decided to take a structured approach and rank them according to factors we know to be determinants for success We finally decided Berlin was clearly the next step for us\n",
      "\n",
      "After deciding on a city I move there to set everything up There are two main areas I’m responsible for The first is Operations amp HR – setting up the legal entity for Ironhack’s new campus securing financing for our students etc and getting together a dream team to run the campus\n",
      "\n",
      "The second key area is marketing We tailor our strategy to each market It’s all about understanding the different customer segments and building brand awareness – once people understand our value proposition they’re always convinced We focus strongly on partnering up with cool companies like N or MoBerries and doing free workshops and events for prospective students It’s all about getting people excited about learning new digital skills\n",

      "Our first cohort in Berlin launches May  \n",
      "\n",
      "What stood out about Berlin Germany Why is this city a great place for Ironhack to have a campus\n",
      "\n",
      "Ironhack already has campuses in Europe – Madrid Barcelona and Paris – so we want to continue to be present in the strongest tech ecosystems and Berlin is proving to be an incredible tech ecosystem Berlin is home to the single largest software market in Europe – thats around a quarter of the European market by value which is pretty crazy There are around  to  active tech startups here including some really disruptive companies The tech ecosystem is booming and the city has the ability to attract and retain talented people like no other place People are flocking to Berlin because they like living here and there’s plenty of job opportunities\n",
      "\n",
      "Also the IT jobs market in Germany has a growing digital skills gap There are a lot of new startups that demand developers and designers along with traditional older companies who are going through a digitalization process McKinsey released a study saying there would be  digital jobs in Berlin by  so that was big data point for us\n",
      "\n",
      "Since students can go to university for free in Berlin why would they want to pay to go to Ironhack\n",
      "\n",
      "Companies are demanding more people with digital skills and fouryear universities just cant cater to that market Ironhack believes universities regardless of whether they are private or public are failing to adapt to the digital revolution The university approach hasn’t changed in  years and getting a job in this day and age requires a different updated approach\n",
      "\n",
      "Ironhack provides highimpact condensed educational experiences with one objective in mind – getting students from zero to job ready in three months Because of this we believe there will always be a gap in the market where we can provide value Regardless we are working hard to make it easier for students to have access to our programs by providing financing options through both private and public channels\n",
      "\n",
      "What will make Ironhack stand out amongst the competition in Berlin\n",
      "\n",
      "We are laserfocused on one objective enabling students to secure a job within three months after graduation\n",
      "\n",
      "So how do we achieve that Well first we make our students employable We constantly update our curriculum to ensure we teach the latest technologies that employers actually demand and we hire professional instructors with realworld experience to teach them We provide career guidance and support throughout the whole program and students are prepared for technical interviews behavioral interviews etc We believe in learning by doing so students come out with three projects to show to the world once they’ve graduated\n",
      "\n",
      "We also focus on giving our students access to those opportunities by securing hiring partners and organizing a career week where students get to meet prospective employers at the end of each cohort\n",
      "\n",
      "What types of applicants are you looking to enroll in the Berlin campus\n",
      "\n",
      "Were looking for career changers There are so many talented people in Berlin who have moved here looking for opportunities Ironhack gives you the possibility to specialize and land a job in three months We cater to anyone who realizes the importance of learning new digital skills and has a passion to learn\n",
      "\n",
      "How many students does Ironhack plan to accommodate at the Berlin campus\n",
      "\n",
      "Were going to have three cohorts in  The first one starts in May the second one in July and the third one in October For the first cohort were looking at about  students We dont like to have cohorts much bigger than that because we want to guarantee quality Moving forward we will look to grow our team and number of cohorts always ensuring students have the best possible experience\n",
      "\n",
      "How do you source new instructors What will be the instructor student ratio\n",
      "\n",
      "We hire real professionals who have worked in the tech industry Our lead instructor for Berlin was working at the Ironhack Paris campus as the lead instructor for a year and he wanted to move to Berlin Hes one of those people who has been coding his whole life He started his own company and hes worked in the industry as a lead developer – he has a very impressive background And he already knows the Ironhack bootcamp and our course so thats always a plus\n",
      "\n",
      "At Ironhack a lead instructor leads the whole program and then we have teaching assistants who are also coding professionals for every eight students to provide support and guide students through the course For example in the first cohort if we have  students we would have one lead instructor and two or three teaching assistants Having gone through the bootcamp myself I feel the teaching assistants play an incredibly important role because they provide valuable assistance throughout the whole bootcamp\n",
      "\n",
      "Will the curriculum at Ironhack Berlin be the same as other Ironhack campuses\n",
      "\n",
      "Ironhack’s current curriculum is divided into three modules Frontend HTML CSS amp Javascript Backend MEAN Stack and Microservices with Angular  API’s We are always looking to make our curriculum better We were teaching Ruby on Rails but we decided to move on to  Also something I always tell prospective students is that you learn how to learn I graduated from the Ruby on Rails course and was able to learn Nodejs on my own just the next month\n",
      "\n",
      "Were in contact with a lot of startups so we make sure our curriculum is exactly what employers need and demand We make a point to keep the curriculum consistent across all campuses This allows us to have a feedback loop at every campus and ensure consistent quality So we’re sticking with the same curriculum in every campus for now but always looking to iterate and make it better\n",
      "\n",
      "Tell us about the Berlin campus What is the classroom like\n",
      "\n",
      "As with most of our new campuses well be located at a WeWork coworking space a new building called Atrium Tower right on Potsdamer Platz The space itself is a big room which holds around  students When we visited the space about a month and a half ago we fell in love with the facilities The campus is accessible from anywhere in town because of its central location and it has an incredible terrace at the top\n",
      "\n",
      "When youre going to be learning for three months in an incredibly intense program being in a nice space with amenities – coffee snacks really nice views – is something really important\n",
      "\n",
      "What are some examples of the types of jobs you envision your Berlin graduates landing after bootcamp\n",
      "\n",
      "We have a very strong reputation worldwide with a global community of alumni and partners For example we just signed up N a mobile bank to be our hiring partner We’re in talks with several Berlin companies to sign them up as hiring partners too At the end of each nineweek course we prepare prospective employers to meet with the students Like I said were very focused on career changers and ensuring our students get a job within three months after graduation\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past weve had companies like Google Twitter Visa Rocket Internet and Magic Leap hire Ironhack graduates So in Berlin were looking for the same profiles Those are global companies we already have partnerships with so our students already have access to that pool of employers Then locally we are looking for the most disruptive companies that are ready to hire entrylevel junior developers\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you envision Berlin grads staying in Berlin Is your focus to get people hired in the city where they studied\n",
      "\n",
      "We have a big focus on having a global community So we really like the idea that our students can access all the communities in all our cities For example I recently passed on the resumes of two graduates from the Madrid UXUI course to Berlinbased N It’s up to each graduate to decide which city to work in\n",
      "\n",
      "A lot of people want to stay in their home city and others dont so we cater to both We try to give opportunities to go abroad and options to work in the local market\n",
      "\n",
      "What would you recommend a complete beginner do to learn more about the tech scene in Berlin\n",
      "\n",
      "I would recommend going to as many meetups and events as you can I always tell people that you never know what opportunities could arise if you put yourself out there and start talking to people We actually just wrote a blog post about How to Land the Tech Job in Berlin and one piece of advice is to mingle Just network\n",
      "\n",
      "Then of course I would recommend going to the Ironhack meetups There are a bunch of workshops in Berlin and our informal network is huge Were doing one free workshop every week and well do some bigger events as well\n",
      "\n",
      "What advice do you have for someone whos thinking about attending a coding bootcamp in Berlin and considering Ironhack\n",
      "\n",
      "Form my experience as an alum I think its all about the attitude When you go into a coding bootcamp theres always this feeling where youre a little bit scared because it is something really demanding People have a natural tendency to be resistant to learn something so technical But just start coding Its not as difficult as it may seem and having the right guidance is key We’re actually launching a cool challenge in Berlin  a free online course to encourage people to get their feet wet with coding\n",
      "\n",
      "A lot more people than we believe have the aptitude for it and actually become really good programmers You just have to take a leap of faith and commit to three months of very intense work We have a  placement rate and while we do have a rigorous admissions process the majority of our students get hired I recommend people to just go for it I can guarantee that if you have the right attitude youll succeed\n",

      "Whats your background What drew you to want to work with Ironhack\n",
      "\n",
      "After starting my career in Private Equity I joined Jumiaa Rocket Internet company also called the African Amazon I was Head of Operations in North Africa and then Managing Director of TunisiaI got in touch with Ariel and Gonzalo the founders of Ironhack and was really inspired by their vision Also since I actually attended a coding bootcamp myself I was excited to come and work in this industry I saw the great potential the bootcamp model had in Europe and also Latin America I was keen to have an impact on people’s lives so I was super receptive to our conversation and working with Ironhack It was a great fit\n",
      "\n",
      "As the VP of Expansion can you describe your role\n",
      "\n",
      "As VP of Expansion I work with the founders to create a strategy and decide which markets make sense for us to open in next Then Im involved with the operations preparation where I actually launch the new markets\n",
      "\n",
      "There are three main areas to consider when launching in a new market The first is human resources – we want to build an awesome team including a general manager We were super excited to find a great GM for our Mexico campus Marketing and brand awareness is number two When youre launching in a new market you want to increase the brand awareness and convince your first students of the benefits of the new campus It can be difficult in a new market because we are starting from scratch so we have to leverage the use of marketing channels such as public relations events and partnerships to integrate ourselves into the local ecosystem The third area is legal – making sure the legal administration is completed If you succeed in those three areas you are ready to open in any market\n",
      "\n",
      "What stood out about Mexico City Why did Ironhack choose to open a campus there\n",
      "\n",
      "We are one of the leaders in the coding bootcamp industry globally and we’ve been thinking about opening in Latin America for quite some time Latin America is a great market because there is so much demand for tech skills but there is a limited number of established bootcamps in the area In  it is estimated there will be a deficit of  IT jobs in Mexico so we can have a great impact on that We want to train the new generation of technology professionals to join the industry Not many if any bootcamps have campuses in the US Europe and in Latin America so Latin America was very attractive to us\n",
      "\n",
      "Mexico City was the preferred choice because it has a booming tech ecosystem Its one of the largest markets for startups Mexico City is the entry for many tech companies moving to Latin America – Facebook Amazon and so on – so many tech multinationals are moving in  The ecosystem is not just booming its also maturing significantly well as there are plenty of VC’s accelerators and company builders\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally its a pretty friendly environment for internet technology and computer science Its a big market to penetrate but its less difficult than some other markets because there are no global competitors There are obviously some local competitors whom we respect a lot but we are going to give the Mexico City ecosystem access to Ironhack’s global community which is already present in Miami Paris Barcelona and Madrid We think building ties within those markets will excite students learning in Mexico City\n",
      "\n",
      "There are only a few bootcamps in Mexico City How will Ironhack stand out once other bootcamps start to pop up\n",
      "\n",
      "Ironhack will stand out because we are global We have already learned so much about running a bootcamp because each market we operate in has different standards and different challenges So by bringing this experience into the market we are raising the coding bootcamp standards for Mexico City Ironhack has graduated  students so we have a large community We have alumni working for Amazon Google and IBM which is a big plus We have great reviews on Course Report and we have great student satisfaction for our curriculum Over the four years we have been operating we have continued to improve our teaching methods\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the Ironhack Mexico City campus like\n",
      "\n",
      "Our offices are at the WeWork Insurgentes coworking space and its amazing to work alongside different Mexico City startups and see how dynamic the space is It’s super exciting We’re in the Colonia Napoles which is like a district of startups At WeWork we take up two rooms of  x  feet each which hold between  to  students We will start with one class and then eventually have two classes rolling at the same time – one UXUI design course and one web development course\n",
      "\n",
      "Our objective at Ironhack is not quantitative its more qualitative so we are not going to accept students if they dont have the required technical level We are selective with students and we dont accept everyone\n",
      "\n",
      "Could you describe the Ironhack application process Is it the same across campuses\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes We have two interviews – one personal interview and one technical interview You can make it through the technical interview even if you dont have tons of knowledge but you must be a hard worker If you prepare your case you can make it in but we want to be selective\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the bootcamp starts we also have prework and the objective is to have everyone at the same knowledge level when we start the course People are spending a lot of time and money to really improve so the courses are very intensive for that reason\n",
      "\n",
      "Ironhack teaches UXUI design and web development Will you be teaching the same curriculum in Mexico City\n",
      "\n",
      "We collect feedback in each market and with each piece of feedback we receive we improve our curriculum little by little We trust and use the same curriculum in every market You can’t scale efficiently if you have each market doing different classes The feedback loops in all the different markets allow us to have the best quality program I don’t think we could have the best quality if we made too many specificities for the various cities\n",
      "\n",
      "How many instructors will you have at the Mexico City campus\n",
      "\n",
      "The number of instructors will grow as the number of students and the number of classes increase For instance at the Paris campus four months after launching we had seven teachers It will be the same for Mexico So we’ll start with one instructor and then after a few months seven and after one year maybe  – were going to see how fast it grows\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Ironhack is a global bootcamp how do you help with the job search and placement What sort of jobs do you expect graduates to get\n",
      "\n",
      "We are trying to build partnerships with Linio TIP and many Mexican startups where we can place our students Companies will be invited to Hiring Week at the end of the bootcamp to see what type of talent we produce We’ll start by targeting companies in Mexico City and then we’ll expand and make partnerships with companies in Guadalajara and Monterrey as a second step\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of our graduates become junior developers We have less entrepreneurs and more junior developers Ironhack focuses on career changers and trying to help them to achieve their ambitions so that’s why we are so focused on placement with Iron Week and a placement manager in each market\n",
      "\n",
      "Is it pretty normal for graduates to stay in the city where they studied\n",
      "\n",
      "We are seeing graduates stay in the city where they studied unless they’re coming from abroad We have a few international students and currently most of them go to the Barcelona and Paris campuses We dont know about Mexico City graduates yet but most of our applications so far are from Mexico – with some international applicants as well\n",
      "\n",
      "If someone is a beginner and thinking about attending a coding bootcamp in Mexico City like Ironhack do you have any meetup or event suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes Ironhack is doing a huge fullday event at WeWork on December th Anyone can attend and it’s free This is a great opportunity to learn about tech discover the Mexico City ecosystem and decide if you want to apply to Ironhack\n",
      "\n",
      "What advice do you have for people thinking about attending a coding bootcamp like Ironhack\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing is it’s an amazing commitment and if you are applying for good reasons and have the technical ability you will be accepted and get the best experience Its a once in a lifetime experience to spend nine weeks changing your career You will learn so much meet new companies and get hired If you want to learn more go to the Ironhack website download the application guide and come to some events We have a Meetup group and Facebook page You can read plenty of reviews of the school on Course Report If you are sure of your motivations you are a hard worker and you’re committed Im sure you will be accepted\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you have any additional comments about the Ironhack’s new Mexico City campus\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "First as the France General Manager tell me how you’ve been involved with the new Ironhack campus\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure As a General Manager I have been involved in all the dimensions related to the new campus – finding an amazing place for our students recruiting a team of Aplayers setting up the docs and processes and so on I have been working with Alex our Head of International Expansion who has been tremendously helpful We have worked super hard over the last few weeks to make sure that our Paris campus will be on the same standards as the others\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s your background and how did you get involved with bootcamps What drew you to want to work with Ironhack\n",
      "\n",
      "I was coming back from San Francisco where I was working as VP of Strategy and Business Development for CodinGame One of my VC friends told me that Ariel and Gonzalo the cofounders were looking for someone to launch Ironhack in France I met the two of them and immediately embraced their vision and got impressed by their ability to execute fast and well I got super excited by the project and the team so a couple of days later I was in Miami to work on the strategy and the launch plan for France It’s been  months now and honestly I’ve never been happier to wake up in the morning and start a new day\n",
      "\n",
      "Ironhack is launching their Paris campus on June th Why is Paris a great place for a coding bootcamp Could you explain Ironhack’s motivation to expand there\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of funding France is now the nd largest tech ecosystem in Europe right after England Over the last  years it has grown exponentially and is now one of the key tech hubs in the world Take Station F for instance – thanks to Xavier Niel cofounder of Free Paris will now have the biggest incubator in the world That growth has fueled an increasing demand for new skills in the tech economy and the talent shortage is not filled by the traditional education players There’s an amazing opportunity for us to expand here and we’ll do everything we can to reach our targets\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a few other coding bootcamps in Paris What will make Ironhack stand out amongst the competition\n",
      "\n",
      "Several initiatives and players have appeared over the last couple of years which shows you how dynamic the market is I think  elements will set Ironhack apart from the competition First our courses are focused on the latest technologies – for example fullstack Javascript for Web Development – and we constantly iterate to improve both the content and the academic experience Then we dedicate a large share of the course  to handson reallife applications Students work on real projects submitted by partners or by themselves if they want to create their startupbusiness Last we help with the placement of our students if they’re looking for a job coaching for technical and behavioral interviews connections to companiesstartups events etc We have an average placement rate of  after  months across our campuses\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s discuss the Paris campus What is the classroom like What neighborhood is it in\n",
      "\n",
      "The campus is located in the new space opened by WeWork It is located in the th arrondissement near the Paris Opera It is accessible via  metro lines  bus lines  bikesharing stations and  carsharing stations It will be open  for our students\n",
      "\n",
      "The place is absolutely magnificent both in terms of design and community Students will enjoy a large classroom close to the patio and meetingworking rooms to complete their projects and assignments\n",
      "\n",
      "What web development and UXUI design tracks or languages are you teaching at this campus and why Are the ones you’ve chosen particularly popular or relevant in Paris\n",
      "\n",
      "The core curriculum is the same across the different campuses to make sure students have the same academic experience and that we have a strong expertise in our area Then we tailor the mentors the events and the projects to the local specificities of the students and of the ecosystem So for Web Development we’ll be focusing on fullstack Javascript but we’ll be integrating events and mentors around frameworks really popular here ex React or Meteor and industries that are the rising trends ex online media and entertainment\n",
      "\n",
      "How many instructors andor mentors will you have in Paris\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ll have a lead instructor who is a professional developer and highly involved in the open source community He has several years of experience in startups and IT services agencies He’ll be assisted by a TA who is a bit more junior but passionate about education and teaching students Plus we’ll have a network of  mentors to help and coach students for coding as well as for management Mentors will be chosen based on the projects of the students Also the students of the first Web Development session will be sponsored by Florian Jourda Florian was the st engineer at Box and scaled their dev team from  to  people He spent  years in the Silicon Valley and is now Chief Product Officer at Bayes Impact an NGO funded by Google that uses machine learning to solve social problems like unemployment\n",
      "\n",
      "How many students do you usually have in a cohort How many can you accommodate\n",
      "\n",
      "For that first cohort we plan to have  students maximum because we want to make sure we provide the best experience That will ensure a strong monitoring of students as well as a perfect operational execution on our side For the next cohorts we’ll increase the number of students but we won’t go above  and we’ll recruit  or  more TAs to keep the same quality  \n",
      "\n",
      "What kind of hours will students need to put in to be successful\n",
      "\n",
      "Students often ask that question and it’s always hard to answer Everything depends on their learning curve On average students work between  to  hours a week mainly on projects and assignments But we’re fully transparent on this – you can’t learn real hard skills and get a job in  months without fully dedicating yourself We make sure that the atmosphere is as good as it can be so that students won’t see time passing by\n",
      "\n",
      "How is your campus similar or different to the other Ironhack campuses\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that our campus is pretty similar to Miami’s We are located in an amazing coworking space in a very nice neighborhood and with lots of startups around The main difference would be our rooftop on the th floor of the building where we regularly organize events and lunches\n",
      "\n",
      "How are you approaching job placement in a new city Does Ironhack have an employer network already\n",
      "\n",
      "Job placement is one of the elements we tailor to the local realities and needs We have already partnered with + tech companies such as Drivy world leader in peertopeer car rental Jumia the equivalent of Amazon in Africa and Middle East Stootie Europe leader in peertopeer services Kima Ventures VC fund of Xavier Niel with + portfolio companies etc Usually they are large startups from Series A to Series D looking to hire web developers As a GM it will be part of my job to support and help students accomplish their professional projects with our employer partners\n",
      "\n",
      "What types of companies are hiring developers in Paris and why types of companies do you expect to hire from Ironhack’s Paris campus\n",
      "\n",
      "I think there are  types of companies that could hire web developers who graduated from Ironhack – corporations in TelecomMediaTechnology startups from Series A to series D and IT services companies The demand is really intense for the last two options as they’re looking for people mastering the latest technologies in high volumes Based on the enthusiasm they’ve expressed when talking with Ironhack we know they’ll be great recruiting partners  \n",
      "\n",
      "What sort of jobs have you seen graduates get at other Ironhack campuses and what do you expect for Ironhack Paris graduates Do they usually stay in the city after graduation\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the metrics of other campuses usually  of people join a startup as an employee a Junior Web Developer Project Manager or Growth Hacker  create their own startup after the course while  become freelancers usually in Web Development and work on a remote basis We’ll have a good share of students who are not from France originally so we think some of them might leave Paris after the course But we’ll help them find the right opportunity abroad and we’ll keep constant interaction with those students\n",
      "\n",
      "What meetups or resources would you recommend for a complete beginner in Paris who wants to get started\n",
      "\n",
      "France has some great players in the field If you want to get an intro to Javascript I would recommend you visit OpenClassrooms Codecademy or CodeCombat Then in terms of meetups The Family and NUMA are two accelerators with outstanding weekly events Some of them are related to one specific coding topic and they’re usually apprehended at a beginner level\n",
      "\n",
      "Any final thoughts that you’d like our readers to know about Ironhack Paris\n",
      "\n",
      "We want to build something that is nothing like what exists in Paris In  months you’ll be operational in Web Development you’ll meet awesome people students mentors entrepreneurs and you’ll accomplish your professional project Send us an email to know more at parisironhackcom We have a few seats left for the session starting on June th Next session will start on September th If you want to apply just send us your application through this typeform\n",

      "\n",
      "How did you become a successful UX Designer Did you get a degree in “UX Design”\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m a career changer My background was first in film and creative writing and I worked in the film industry in Miami before I ended up in Boston temping as a project manager for a venture capital company with an incubator focused on Harvard and MIT startups I learned from really smart people about computers software graphic design and project management and IBM had their Lotus Notes usability labs next door so I got to participate as a usability tester I went back to grad school at Bentley University for my Masters in Human Factors in Information Design and had a magical career doing ethnography and user research at Microsoft Staples Adidas and Reebok and UX design for Fidelity Investments Staples the Federal Reserve JP Morgan Chase HampR Block Novartis Pharmaceuticals and Zumba Fitness\n",
      "\n",
      "Two years ago I moved back to Miami and started my own product UX Gofer which is a UX research tool\n",
      "\n",
      "After spending years learning User Experience and even getting a Masters degree why do you believe in the bootcamp model as an effective way to learn UX Design\n",
      "\n",
      "I went through my grad program very quickly in one year so I believe that you can learn this material very quickly and then continue learning on the job That’s exactly why I’ve had a successful career by specifically going after different verticals technologies and platforms If I hadn’t used something before I wanted to try it I believe that you can learn the fundamentals quickly and then refine them throughout your career\n",
      "\n",
      "What made you excited to work at Ironhack in particular what stands out about Ironhack to you as a professional UX Designer\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the people I was referred to Ironhack by someone I’ve respected in the industry for years and they were right The people running Ironhack are what convinced me to work on this UX Bootcamp\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you have teaching experience prior to teaching at the bootcamp What is different about teaching at a coding bootcamp\n",
      "\n",
      "I teach now at the University of Miami at conferences and bootcamps At Ironhack my personal teaching style is to lecture very little and focus on handson work It’s important to know the foundations and principles and science behind what we do but at the end of the day you have to deliver So we spend the majority of our days doing activities which means running surveys doing interviews running usability tests designing products I think it’s so important for students to create their portfolio pieces throughout the bootcamp instead of just having one portfolio project at the end of the course For someone breaking into the UX community the portfolio is how students demonstrate their knowledge and how they approach projects\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is Ironhack’s first foray into UXUI design courses Tell us about the curriculum\n",
      "\n",
      "Marcelo Paiva and I created the Ironhack curriculum based on what we would have wanted to learn in a bootcamp if we were to just get started in this field We follow the user and product development lifecycles to make sure that our students have all the skills they need to be useful right now in the current marketplace\n",
      "\n",
      "We start with user research – how to talk to your target market the methodology behind that research what to do with that data deliverables and turning that data into concept design\n",
      "\n",
      "We move into information architecture and interaction design with lowfidelity all the way into highfidelity and micro interaction models We use Invision Sketch and Principal as the tools for that piece of the curriculum Then we move into visual design for mobile and web because they are two different beasts\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we move into frontend development where students learn how to implement the designs they’re creating This is what the industry is looking for right now the unicorns that can do the HTML and bootstrap to implement their own designs That will make Ironhack students really effective and marketable\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally we move into individual projects Ironhack students are building portfolio pieces from Day One but towards the end of the course they work on more specific projects and breakouts for additional topics that we haven’t covered yet\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m so super excited about this bootcamp and I think it’s really valuable\n",
      "\n",
      "Is the push for designers to learn to code the biggest trend in the UXUI field right now\n",
      "\n",
      "It depends on where our graduates choose to work As part of a smaller team a UX Designer will have to be more of a generalist and need to do research design and development If they’re working for a larger organization they can specialize in a particular field within UX like ethnography or mobile design or design thinking As a whole I think careers in the UX community are becoming both broader and more specialized The UX community is both coming together and breaking into niches\n",
      "\n",
      "How many instructors TAs andor mentors do you have Is there an ideal studentteacher ratio\n",
      "\n",
      "The studentteacher ratio for the UXUI course is  Many of the required activities are tackled in groups among the students in groups of  or  As the principal instructor I lead and teach the main flow of the course and we have subject matter experts and mentors come in to teach sections of the curriculum that are more specialized eg design thinking frontend development etc\n",
      "\n",
      "Can you tell us a little bit about the ideal student for Ironhack’s UXUI Design Bootcamp What’s your class like right now And how do the UX students differ from the coding bootcamp students\n",
      "\n",
      "The ideal student for the UXUI Design Bootcamp is someone who possesses strong communication skills can use empathy to jump into other people’s shoes and has a passion for userexperience The current class is a wonderful mix of many professional backgrounds for example some profiles include a former Marketing Manager for Sony Music a Research Director from the nonprofit space and an MBA grad looking to use their previous Business Process skills to crack into the UX sector\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a fulltime bootcamp but how many hours a week do you expect your students to commit to Ironhack Miami\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the daily schedule of am to pm we expect students to spend approximately  hours outside of class time to work on assignments and projects so about  hoursweek\n",
      "\n",
      "In a UX bootcamp is the style largely project based Can you give us an example\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes students will work on  projects during the first  weeks one individual project and one group project These projects are a sum of the individual units we cover on a weekbyweek basis The capstone of the course is a week final project that each student completes individually as they go through the entire user and product development lifecycles The result at the end of the course is that each student has  prototypes that they can use as portfolio pieces moving forward\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s the goal for a student that graduates from Ironhack in terms of career and ability For example will they be prepared for a junior UXUI role A senior role\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal of this course is to provide students the skills to carry out a UXUI design process from beginning to end in multiple circumstances with varying goals As a result students will be prepared for junior and entrylevel roles in UXUI fields depending on which part of that process most interests them\n",
      "\n",
      "For our readers who are beginners what resources or meetups do you recommend for aspiring bootcampers in Miami\n",
      "\n",
      "We hold open houses and free introductory workshops to coding and design monthly which can be found on the Ironhack Meetup page Our friends at IxDA also offer some cool workshops on Meetup\n",

      "The Application\n",
      "\n",
      "How long does the Ironhack application typically take\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ironhack application process falls into  stages the written application first interview and second technical interview and takes on average  days to complete in entirety\n",
      "\n",
      "What goes into the written application Does Ironhack require a video submission\n",
      "\n",
      "The written application is a chance for students to give a quick summary of their background and motivations for wanting to attend It’s their opportunity to tell us about themselves in a nutshell and peak the admission committee’s interest\n",
      "\n",
      "What types of backgrounds have successful Ironhack students had Does everyone come from a technical background\n",
      "\n",
      "We are impressed and inspired by the diversity of students that Ironhack attracts We’ve had former flight attendants worldtravelling yoginis and CS grads from Ivy Leagues all attend Ironhack We’ve been amazed at how coding is so democratic and attracts all sorts of people regardless of educational background or pedigree Those who tend to perform the best at Ironhack are those who have committed to doing so not necessarily those with a technical background\n",

      "\n",
      "Ironhack’s application process reveals a lot of qualities in potential candidates because it is a bit longer than most coding schools The advantage of this is it allows us to see how candidates and applicants respond to learning material in a short amount of time and how dedicated they are to their goals If they can’t even complete the interview process it’s an indicator that they might not have the passion or drive to get through  weeks of a coding bootcamp We look for curiosity passion and drive Drive is probably the most important quality to succeed at Ironhack\n",

      "Tell us about how IronHack started\n",
      "\n",
      "I come from a finance background I’m originally from Puerto Rico but spent  years in New York My cofounder Gonzalo comes from the construction industry he’s a civil engineer and he built all sorts of major infrastructure projects in Europe Having said that I come from a household of educators Both of my parents were teachers when I was growing up and my father actually started a private university in Puerto Rico  years ago that started with  students and now they have  campuses and over  students enrolled\n",
      "\n",
      "I think education was always a part of my DNA and I wanted to do something after completing my education I met Gonzalo during our MBA we were both at Wharton He also wanted to do something in education in Europe and possibly in edtech as well During those  years of the MBA we were iterating ideas constantly and I think had the same issue that most nontechnical founders have in the US which is having brilliant “ideas” but once you get to the point where you need to execute them and produce an MVP you’re not able to do it It’s incredibly challenging to find a cofounder and it’s incredibly challenging from a cost and also from an operational perspective to outsource the development\n",
      "\n",
      "Gonzalo and I took a day course at Wharton where they taught us to do very basic Rails Even though we didn’t acquire the skills necessary to build our MVP we were excited about the possibility of teaching both technical and nontechnical people these skills through a highly intensive and compressed time period After that experience we started looking at the boot camp model At that point the earlier ones were starting to get a little bit of traction We thought it would be interesting to do this somewhere abroad I’d done a lot of business in Latin America so I had some ties to the region Gonzalo my partner is Spanish so our first bet was Spain\n",

      "Would you say that IronHack is more geared towards makers or technical cofounders as opposed to people who want to get a job at an established company as a junior developer\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve had both profiles We’ve been selective in the people we admit from a technical background We’ve been hesitant so far to say “go from total newbie to professional web developer in X weeks” Our approach is appealing to folks that are maybe already in close touch with technology and code Developers that want to professionalize their skills and take them to the next level or people that are very smart analytical and are looking for a hardcore experience that will allow them to learn from these types of people\n",

      "\n",
      "The other thing we learned was that no matter how much you filter to make sure you don’t have disparate levels prior to arriving people just learn differently at different velocities with different learning styles So within the structure of  weeks we needed different exercises and flexibility to give people the chance to learn right at their own pace while ensuring that everyone’s learning fundamentals\n",

      "\n",
      "Barcelona is very exciting because you have people from all over the world that are launching startups there Obviously within the EU there’s a lot of mobility if you’re a European Union citizen you can go anywhere without any sort of visa requirements And I think a lot of northern Europeans and people from Germany for instance love Barcelona for weather reasons the great beaches the lifestyle… so a lot of them are coming over to Barcelona to launch their own ventures here In Barcelona the tech ecosystem is thriving and it’s very international There’s a lot of mobile startups that are getting traction over there\n",
      "\n",
      "Madrid is still very much a cosmopolitan city and we’re seeing a lot of traction in the startup space It’s obviously an emerging ecosystem nowhere near Silicon Valley but we’re seeing early stage companies  get either acquired or go for substantial rounds of financing here in Madrid which is ultimately a driver for our type of business Companies need funding to employ engineers and we’re seeing that capital flow to early stage projects\n",

      "Is it possible for someone from the US to complete IronHack and then work in Spain or in the EU\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes it’s definitely possible It’s not as challenging as someone from Europe to go to the US For sure there’s still costs that the employer has to incur but it has nowhere near the costs and all the red tape that you have to deal with in the US\n",

      "\n",
      "The Web course is an week course I’d say on average students are with us in our offices  –  hours a day We cover HTML CSS and JavaScript on the front end and then on the back we work with Ruby on Rails and teach a little bit of Sinatra as well The first  weeks we’re teaching those core technologies And the last  weeks students are working on their own project from scratch The culmination of the program is a demo day where they present their projects to the community developers startup cofounders that type of audience\n",
      "\n",
      "I’d say  of our content is practical We’re big believers in the flipped classroom model so we want to make sure that we reduce the amount of theory time to the extent possible We get them all the resources videos and exercises to complete at home prior to arriving here While they’re here we give them homework and assignments for the weekend so we can reduce that theory time\n",
      "\n",
      "The technology demands in Spain are very fragmented It’s not like San Francisco where you can produce a gazillion Ruby on Rails grads every year and they’ll be hired by Rails startups Here we’re seeing some demand for Rails startups – but also Python PHP etc\n",

      "\n",
      "A hundred percent and we’re seeing that Even though love the technologies we work with we’re not obsessed with them either To us they’re an instrument to teach good development practices I think one thing that differentiates us from boot camps is our focus and obsession with good coding practices We’re obsessed with testing clean code and good design patterns We’ve done our job if the student get a good background in technology but more importantly take away those good coding practices that they apply to whatever language or framework they use\n",

      " \n",
      "\n",
      "How many instructors do you have per class\n",
      "\n",
      "We always like to have a ratio of at least  students per teacher So when we have  students we have one main professor and two teaching assistants Our view is that if we’re going to teach you one technology we want to make sure that the person that is instructing you is the best most capable person and is highly specialized in that language\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "How have you found instructors\n",
      "\n",
      "We went to the best companies here in Spain and other parts of Europe and basically found the best people there They work part time for us It’s very different to have someone who’s fulltime boot camp professor versus someone who is a developer and is teaching at a boot camp for  weeks\n",
      "\n",
      "And also from a recruiting perspective a lot of our students have been hired by their teachers Also our students have a network that goes beyond their peers and the Ironhack staff they have a network that connects to all these companies that these professors are coming from\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "You said that potential students should have some vested interest in programming and should have some background and be able to prove that they can really handle the material What’s the application process\n",
      "\n",
      "We have a step application process The first part is a written form that we screen and then we do two minute Skype interviews The first minute Skype interview is to get a sense of who you are why you want to do this and get a sense of is you fit within our culture and if you have that intrinsic motivation to make the most out of the  hours that you have here\n",
      "\n",
      "We say “Listen you’re going to be coding Monday through Friday  hours a day and then you’re going to have work every day on SaturdaySunday…” When I tell them that we want someone who beams energy and positivity If they make it through that interview we have a second round which is basically to assess technical skills We’ve actually accepted a bunch of people that have never programmed before but we want to make sure that you have the motivation and the analytical skill set to be able to catch up prior to arriving to our camp\n",
      "\n",
      "In some cases we have people that we think are very smart and incredibly motivated but have never coded in their lives have never even worked with HTML We admit them subject to another valuation post that second interview So we’ll get them to complete  hours of prework and then see where they are\n",

      "How does IronHack prepare your graduates to find jobs\n",
      "\n",
      "The demo day is a great way to showcase our talent to our employers and you have all sorts of employers there from the founding stage where they haven’t raised any money or are still preproduct to tech employers who have technical teams and more than   employees\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of the core curriculum we have speakers like employers come in during the  weeks to present their products and also it serves as an opportunity for them to get in touch with their students and identify potential hiring leads\n",
      "\n",
      "We also bring in leading HR people from some of our top tech employers here to offer workshops on how to set up your CV how to optimize your LinkedIn profile SEO and all these things And we coach them on how to conduct an interview Right now we’ve had the luxury of being small so we’re all very involved in the process\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Are those companies paying a fee to get into the demo day or are they paying a recruiting fee once they’ve hired someone\n",
      "\n",
      "Right now we’re not charging employers We’re focused on placing  of our graduates and giving access to great companies even those that wouldn’t be interested in paying a recruiting fee\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Have you been successful in placing your graduates\n",
      "\n",
      "We’re starting to place a second cohort but in our first cohort we placed nearly  percent of our graduates I think in the first cohort we placed  of the people  week after the first course and then the rest over the next  months\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Is the accreditation buzz that’s happening in California anywhere on your radar Do you get any pressure from the government in Spain or are you thinking about going through the accreditation process when you expand to Miami\n",
      "\n",
      "We’re definitely going to pay attention to this in Miami We’re all for it if it helps the student as long as it doesn’t interfere with the model and doesn’t limit the ability of these institutions to offer education that’s agile and that can adapt to the times and the technologies\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Are you planning on expanding beyond Miami anytime soon\n",
      "\n",
      "I think for the next year or even beyond that we’re going to focus on Miami and Spain However we’re going to use Miami and Spain as hubs for other regions We’re getting a lot of interest from Latin American Students to come to Spain so for those who would rather come to Miami because it’s closer we can offer that as well\n",

      "About Me\n",
      "I worked in IT, and did some coding, but nothing past basic JavaScript. It peaked my interest, so I began learning on my own by taking courses online. I realized I needed to go about learning in a different way. I researched courses/boot camps and ran into Ironhack and decided to dive in and take it’s Full-Time Web Dev course after coming across great reviews/ratings.\n",
      "Expectations and Course Run Down\n",
      "Be ready to learn, because you’re going to learn a lot. It's a full time 9-5pm every day for 9 weeks (not including the after hours you want to put in as well) it's no joke so just prepare to fully invest the next 9 weeks into IronHack. You learn for 2 weeks and then immediately are sent off to create a project within a week - repeat again 2 more times after that. Come in prepared to learn, take in all the material, and be willing to put in the work.\n",
      "Help During Course Work / Curriculum (TA’s and Teacher)\n",
      "The instructor for our Cohort (Nick) was very knowledgeable. The only downside was that it was his first time teaching the course, so it felt like he was also learning as we were all trying to learn something too. Besides that, he was most definitely a great instructor and without his proficiency on the subject, I would not have learned as much as I did. As for the teaching assistants, all three of them were amazing (Sandra, Marcos, Ian). They were all very familiar with the coursework since they were all Ironhack graduates as well. It was extremely helpful having dedicated TA's who were former students helping us because they know the struggle so they WANT to help. There's more than enough help to go around, just make sure to ASK for it when you need it and you won't fall behind.\n",
      "The coursework definitely needed some tweaking on some days, our instructor Nick pushed aside what he felt was wrong and obsolete and taught it the best way he could and it definitely worked out. During the course this was one of my top issues, the curriculum for sure needed an update, but from what I have seen after my time there they are (or already have) taken the steps necessary to do so. Which means they take your feedback seriously and won't brush your input aside.\n",
      "Rest of Ironhack Staff\n",
      "Since the first day I applied and even now the staff at Ironhack hasn’t missed a beat. They have been helpful and there for me with any questions I had. They have an idea as to what they want to do with the course, and they definitely make sure that you receive the best experience possible. It doesn’t matter who you try to contact, the owner, down to the TA’s, they all respond happily and make you feel like one of them.\n",
      "Hiring Fair Prep\n",
      "From the first week at Ironhack, you become well acquainted with a man named Brito. Take his advice seriously if your goal is getting a job. He walks you through all the necessary steps to prepare you, such as building your resume, creating your LinkedIn, and lets you know about networking events to attend. He constantly brings in people to give speeches to you weekly. Brito is a great source for help and information so make sure you are constantly checking in with him. Along with all this prep work, you are also creating your portfolio during the course. You create 3 projects (on your own or in a small group) which showcase everything you've learned in the course from beginning to end and is the first step to the building of your portfolio.\n",
      "Hiring Fair Event\n",
      "At the end of the course, Brito arranges companies to come to Ironhack and sit down with you for interviews. This is a valuable introduction for your first interviews. Eventually, you will be off doing interviews on your own and this hiring fair is a great way to evaluate what you did and didn't do so that ultimately you become more and more comfortable during them. Still, that doesn't mean you shouldn't take these interviews at the hiring fair seriously, definitely come prepared to nail them during the event - people DO get hired out of these. This is what you prepare for, and it helps to prepare for future interviews.\n",
      "Post Ironhack Experience\n",
      "After Ironhack, finding a job (if that is what you are there for) is the next battle. Brito is there with you every step of the way. He holds placements help meetings at Ironhack every other week and is always available for any questions you have. He guides you and reminds you that you must KEEP CODING and KEEP APPLYING. If you slack off on those two steps, the job hunt instantly becomes much harder.  Take your LinkedIn, networking, and resume seriously. Do little projects on your own after the cohort, and make sure your JavaScript knowledge is fresh by doing coding challenges on HackerRank/Codewars because they will help with the technical interviews.\n",
      "I did not get hired immediately after Ironhack. I applied to around 300+ jobs and only got about two handfuls of phone interviews and in-person interviews. I got hired 3 and a half months after. I never stopped coding, I never stopped applying and I always kept in touch with Brito. This process in itself could feel more stressful than the boot camp, but do not quit.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "Yes - you learn a lot at Ironhack and are given great guidance, but no they will not hand you a job. You get everything you need from them and now it’s up to you to put in the work and land it. They are there with you every step of the way. I would 100% do it again, I put my life on hold, invested in myself, pushed through and changed my career into something I felt would be more fulfilling. So far it hasn’t disappointed one bit. Not only do you learn a lot at Ironhack, but you make tons of friends and become part of their great community.\n",

I had an all-around wonderful learning experience. You don't need to have much computer knowledge going into it, because each class has multiple teaching assistants who will be there to help if you fall behind or are struggling to keep up. My class had 3 exceptional TA's, Manuel, Colby, and Adrian, who constantly were able to provide assistance when I ran into trouble, had bugs, or just got lost. They were always nice, patient, and willing to go the extra mile just to make sure I really understood deeply what we were learning, including coming in extra early on the weekends and spending one on one time with me in front of the whiteboard to go over each aspect of what we were learning in detail. I was really impressed with -and grateful for- each of them. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was also very impressed with the professor, Alan. He is an extremely knowledgeable person with a natural aptitude for teaching. Always patient, courteous, and welcoming of questions, feedback and taking time to ask us if we all understood or were running into any problems. What really impressed me most about Alan, is how he would take a little bit of time at the start of each class to go beyond the curriculum and to challenge us with computer science coding challenges, to prepare us to think like computer scientists, and get us ready for the types of questions we would likely see in a coding interview, and explain the different ways to approach the problems, and how to think about them in terms of time complexity or memory management. It was well beyond what I expected from a web development course, and I found these lessons particularly rewarding. Alan has a knack for breaking down complex and abstract concepts into digestible bits and getting the class comfortable enough to try and collectively attempt a solution. *Protip* Always volunteer to try and solve the problems he presents, I noticed the students brave enough to attempt these problems retained information better and walked away with a more solid understanding. If he gives you the marker, get up there and give it your best effort. Go home and research the concepts further. JUST DO IT!  Get a whiteboard, for your house, and write important concepts, objectives, goals, and problem examples from class. This will force your brain to reconcile this new information on a daily basis. You will almost certainly see these types of coding challenges in job interviews, and they're abstract, and frustrating if you are not prepared.\n",
      "\n",
      "After graduation, you'll be counseled by Brito, your career counselor, who is also a very cool, down-to-earth and knowledgeable person. He has some real wisdom to share about the interviewing process, how to construct your resume, and specifically tells you to reach out to him before accepting any job offers. I am really impressed with his insight and willingness to be supportive, helpful, and make sure you land a good starting job, well after graduation. \n",
      "\n",
      "Looking back I am extremely thankful to Ironhack and humbled to have had the opportunity to study with such an awesome class. Everyone from my classmates to the teachers, to the teacher's assistants, to the career counselor have all been an absolute pleasure to deal with. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I was blown away by the Ux/UI students. We (the web dev class) got a chance to work with them in the hackathon (which was a totally awesome experience) and they were very impressive. I legitimately wish I could go take their class as well because they absolutely blew my mind with their systematic methodology, creativity, and organized thought processes. They were amazing. I loved working with them. \n",
      "\n",
      " So to wrap it up, I wholeheartedly recommended Ironhacks web development course. 110%. Actively participate, ask questions, be engaged, help classmates, keep a positive attitude and this bootcamp will be a life-changing event for you as it has been for me. \n",

      "\n",
      "After living all over the world and dipping her toes in graphic design, finance, and entrepreneurship, Dafne Olca was looking for a career where she would always keep learning. She eventually tried a free coding course, loved it, and decided to enroll in Ironhack’s web development bootcamp in Barcelona, Spain (taught in English). Dafne tells us how learning to code was both very difficult and very satisfying, how supportive Ironhack was (and still is) for her career, and how much she is enjoying being a Front End Developer in her new job at Everis, a European consulting firm!\n",
      "Q&A\n",
      "What’s your career and education background? How did your path lead to a bootcamp?\n",
      "My career path has been very diverse so far. I’m originally from Austria and I did a bachelor’s degree in multimedia in London and Honolulu, with the aim of working in graphic design and video production, but I found the job opportunities were not the kind of jobs I imagined them to be. Then I did an MBA in Vienna and San Diego to increase my career options and ended up in finance in Barcelona.\n",
      "After three years, I got bored with finance and wanted to figure out what to do with my life. I had always been interested in technology and worked for a while on a family business focused on the Internet of Things. I enjoyed researching technologies, philosophical aspects of the business, and looking at the direction in which the world is heading.\n",
      "I eventually came across Free Code Camp and enjoyed it a lot. My friends who work in web development told me if I became a web developer, I would be learning for the rest of my life. At first that sounded intimidating, but it made me realize that’s exactly what I want to do with my life – it’s a way to make sure I won’t get bored, I can keep learning, and getting better at what I do. It goes hand-in-hand with my personality because I love to learn and do new things. I think that’s why web development is the right choice for me.\n",
      "You’ve traveled a lot – what made you choose Ironhack in Barcelona, rather than another bootcamp in a different city, going back to college, or teaching yourself?\n",
      "I considered teaching myself, but going to university wasn’t an option – it was between teaching myself and going to the bootcamp. As a beginner, the best way to change careers was to go full-on, and be around professionals – the teachers at Ironhack are very talented, and are professionals who have been in the field for a long time.\n",
      "I moved to Barcelona three years ago, and fell in love with the city, so it was clear to me that I wanted to do a bootcamp here. I talked to people about the best technologies and languages to learn, and everyone confirmed that Ironhack had the best full-stack JavaScript curriculum. Barcelona has a good tech atmosphere and a growing startup scene. I’d eventually like to have the flexibility to work remotely, and I think that Barcelona will allow that.\n",
      "Also, the course I did was taught in English. In Barcelona, Ironhack offers one full-time cohort in English, and one full-time cohort and one part-time cohort in Spanish.\n",
      "What was the Ironhack application and interview process like for you?\n",
      "The first part was a personality interview to see if you’re really genuinely interested in doing the course and pursuing a career in web development. After passing that first interview, I was given some very basic coding exercises. After those exercises, I had a technical interview with a teacher assistant, which I passed before getting accepted into Ironhack.\n",
      "What was the learning experience like at Ironhack? What was the teaching style?\n",
      "I have to be honest, it was very very tough for me. This was the first time I had done a course in web development. Ironhack was split into three modules. First we had the basic front end module, which was pretty doable. The second module was back end, which for me was very difficult, then the final module was back end with the Angular framework, which was also demanding.\n",
      "The hours were very intense. Officially, the hours are 9am to 6pm, like a full-time job, but I don’t remember many days when we actually finished at 6. If you’re at Ironhack, then it’s in your best interest to get as much out of the program as you can.\n",
      "The teaching was also quite intense. I’m 30 now so I had been out of school for many years, and going back to lectures was a lot more demanding than I thought it would be. But as intense as it was, it was also very satisfying. Your character really shows when you’re learning web development – you have to deal with daily frustrations and a lot of challenges, but overcoming those challenges is really rewarding.\n",
      "What was your cohort like?\n",
      "Ironhack was one of the most diverse experiences I’ve ever had. Some of my classmates were 18 and had come straight out of high school, and the oldest guy was in his late 40s. The average person was somebody who had decided to change their career.\n",
      "We were very international. There were around 22 students in my class – four of those students were Spanish, and the rest of them were from all over the world, including Europeans and Latin Americans.\n",
      "What was your favorite project that you built at Ironhack?\n",
      "My favorite project was my first project – I created a game of blackjack with front end JavaScript. Since it was my first project, I felt like I had accomplished something that I never in my life thought I could have accomplished. Of course we got help from the teachers, but it’s quite impressive to see what you, yourself are capable of doing. Before we started the project, I was clueless. I honestly had no idea what I was going to do, how I was going to do it, and I didn’t believe I could do it. But after completing the project, it was really impressive to see what I could get myself to do.\n",
      "How did Ironhack prepare you for job hunting?\n",
      "When I was researching bootcamps, it was really important for me to be able to land a job as soon as possible, and Ironhack pretty much guarantees that almost all alumni who want to find work will find work in the field. Right after bootcamp, we had a hiring day where more than 20 recruiters from tech companies came to the campus to see our work. It was a quick interview where we show them our project, they ask questions, they get to know us, and we get to know the companies.\n",
      "Sonia, my Careers Adviser, was always getting in touch with companies, and getting my input about what I’d like to do. On top of that, I thought it was amazing that after I landed a job and needed some guidance, one of the TAs still gave me advice and input. Even now, I feel like I can go back to Ironhack and get support any time I need it. I try not to milk it, but they are just so helpful and so caring.\n",
      "So you’ve been working at Everis for 7 months now! Congrats! How did you find the job?\n",
      "Everis did come to Ironhack for the hiring day, but I didn’t get a chance to talk to them because there were so many companies there. So the next day, I contacted them and told them I had missed them, but I wanted to get to know them – I was quite active about reaching out to companies. They replied immediately, I went into the office that same day for an interview. Within two weeks, they called me in for a second interview, and shortly after that I received an offer. I was exhausted after graduating from Ironhack, so I took a month off over the holidays, but about a month into my job search, I was working at Everis.\n",
      "Can you tell me about Everis and what you work on there?\n",
      "Everis is a consultancy, so we work on projects with different clients. I’m a Junior Front End Developer, and I work with Angular and Typescript. It’s a purely front end job, which is what I wanted.\n",
      "I’m on my second project since I started at Everis. The first project was a web app to help organizations apply for governmental loans. It was a very small, global team – two people in Barcelona, two people in Zaragoza, Spain, and the project manager was based in Brussels, Belgium. For my current project there are four of us and we’re all based in Barcelona, except for the project manager who is based in Zaragoza.\n",
      "It’s a huge company, I think there are about 3000 people in Barcelona, and they have branches around the world. The company is very diverse, and the teams are very diverse as well. They have an emphasis on hiring very gender-balanced teams, which is nice; Everis is definitely more gender-balanced than other companies.\n",
      "Are you using the technologies and programming languages at Everis that you learned at Ironhack?\n",
      "I’m working in Angular, which is a framework we covered in the third module of Ironhack. There are always new things to learn in Angular, because Angular is quite complex and always evolving. So I haven’t learned any new languages or frameworks, but I had to learn more about Angular on the job.\n",
      "Ironhack provided us with the tools to be able to teach ourselves new technologies more easily. In the future, I will inevitably need to learn more languages and frameworks. But now I have the right tools to be able to teach myself a lot more easily than before the bootcamp.\n",
      "Since you joined Everis, how do you feel you’ve grown as a front-end developer?\n",
      "In 6 months, I feel like I’ve become a lot more independent, and I’m less afraid of touching the code. In addition, I’ve developed a passion for problems! As weird as that sounds, I enjoy running into problems because I enjoy solving them. It’s very fulfilling. Honestly, I think Ironhack is the best decision I’ve made in my life in terms of academia and career development. I haven’t regretted it once.\n",
      "How has your background in graphic design, finance, and entrepreneurship been useful in your new job as a Front End Developer?\n",
      "Graphic design is very much about trends, and it’s been a long time since I studied it. While there are some aspects of design that still apply, a lot has changed. At Everis, when we get a new project, a lot of the design is given by the client – my job is more about implementing the logic and functions rather than the design itself.\n",
      "My experience working in finance has definitely been useful at Everis. Having experience in a huge corporation definitely helps you work with other people and clients in a professional environment.\n",
      "What’s been the biggest challenge or roadblock in your journey to becoming a Front End Developer?\n",
      "Sometimes you can get stuck on a problem for a really long time, and you start having to deal with your own frustrations. The more you get frustrated, the more you block your brain and the less you can really think logically. That’s a challenge that I’ve had to learn to deal with, and I’m really learning how to be calm and patient. I wasn’t a patient person before, and I’m now really seeing the results of patience.\n",
      "It sounds like Ironhack has stayed involved in your career – have you kept in touch with other alumni?\n",
      "I was just at Ironhack last week actually and I’m going again soon. A lot of people from my cohort have left, but I’ve gotten to know people from the cohorts before and after mine, and we’ve become quite tight. It’s a very strong community. Whenever Ironhack hosts events, I prioritize them – it’s a very good atmosphere and a great network, and every time I go there I feel like I’m at home.\n",
      "What advice do you have for people making a career change through a coding bootcamp?\n",
      "Just do it. My best advice is to stay calm and be aware that you’re going to reach your mental limits. You’re going to have a hard time, but it’s really worth it and it’s very rewarding. There are going to be times when you’ll want to feel very stupid – don’t! If you can be a master of your emotions, then you have a good path ahead.\n",

      "“Berlin is proving to be an incredible tech ecosystem.” With campuses in Miami, Madrid, Paris, Mexico and Barcelona, Ironhack is launching their web development bootcamp in Berlin, Germany in 2018 to take advantage of the growing tech scene. We spoke with Ironhack’s EMEA Expansion Lead, Alvaro Rojas, about the Berlin campus at a WeWork space, how Ironhack is recruiting lots of local hiring partners, and what sort of jobs Ironhack graduates can expect to get in Berlin. Plus, as an Ironhack grad himself, Alvaro gives advice on where to start as a new coder.\n",
      "Q&A\n",
      "What's your background and how did you get involved with Ironhack?\n",
      "My background is in strategy consulting. I studied business in London, and then I worked in strategic consulting for tech startups in Spain and California. I worked for the Embassy of Spain in Los Angeles for a little while, and then I launched my own venture there.\n",
      "I'm actually an Ironhack graduate. Working in the tech industry, I had always been interested in learning how to code. So I did some research online and I found Ironhack. I graduated from Ironhack around a year and a half ago.\n",
      "I fell in love with the company’s mission and the community they were creating. You hear some really incredible stories when you're working with people from such diverse backgrounds. After graduating, I kept in touch with Gonzalo Manrique, one of the co-founders, so when they decided to expand in Europe, he contacted me about the EMEA (Europe, Middle Eastern, and Africa) Expansion Lead position. It was a no-brainer for me.\n",
      "Did you attend Ironhack to become a developer or did you just want to pick up coding skills?\n",
      "I wanted to pick up coding skills. I think everybody in the future should become literate in some kind of coding language, even if you’re not planning on working as a developer. Most jobs in the future will require a basic knowledge of programming, and I wanted to stay ahead of the curve. If you work in tech, understanding how software is built is a must, regardless of your position. Eventually, machines will dominate the world and you’ll have to speak their language!\n",
      "You have this unique perspective of actually being a student before working as staff at Ironhack.\n",
      "Absolutely. It's easier for me to explain the benefits behind Ironhack because I've lived through the whole experience. It's really great when we do events and prospective students ask me about Ironhack. The first thing I tell them is, \"Look, I'm an alum, I went through the whole experience. I can tell you everything you need to know, and everything you'll go through.\" It was definitely one of the most challenging and rewarding times in my life.\n",
      "Tell us about your role at Ironhack.\n",
      "The first step when I started was working with the co-founders and the VP of Ops & Expansion, Alex Berriche, to make a strategy plan for Europe. We had various cities in mind and decided to take a structured approach and rank them according to factors we know to be determinants for success. We finally decided Berlin was clearly the next step for us.\n",
      "After deciding on a city, I move there to set everything up. There are two main areas I’m responsible for. The first is Operations & HR – setting up the legal entity for Ironhack’s new campus, securing financing for our students etc, and getting together a dream team to run the campus.\n",
      "The second key area is marketing. We tailor our strategy to each market. It’s all about understanding the different customer segments and building brand awareness – once people understand our value proposition they’re always convinced. We focus strongly on partnering up with cool companies like N26 or MoBerries, and doing free workshops and events for prospective students. It’s all about getting people excited about learning new digital skills.\n",
      "Our first cohort in Berlin launches May 21, 2018.\n",
      "What stood out about Berlin, Germany? Why is this city a great place for Ironhack to have a campus?\n",
      "Ironhack already has campuses in Europe – Madrid, Barcelona, and Paris – so we want to continue to be present in the strongest tech ecosystems, and Berlin is proving to be an incredible tech ecosystem. Berlin is home to the single largest software market in Europe – that's around a quarter of the European market by value, which is pretty crazy. There are around 2,000 to 2,500 active tech startups here, including some really disruptive companies. The tech ecosystem is booming, and the city has the ability to attract and retain talented people like no other place. People are flocking to Berlin because they like living here and there’s plenty of job opportunities.\n",
      "Also, the IT jobs market in Germany has a growing digital skills gap. There are a lot of new startups that demand developers and designers, along with traditional older companies who are going through a digitalization process. McKinsey released a study saying there would be 100,000 digital jobs in Berlin by 2020, so that was big data point for us.\n",
      "Since students can go to university for free in Berlin, why would they want to pay to go to Ironhack?\n",
      "Companies are demanding more people with digital skills, and four-year universities just can't cater to that market. Ironhack believes universities, regardless of whether they are private or public, are failing to adapt to the digital revolution. The university approach hasn’t changed in 100 years, and getting a job in this day and age requires a different, updated approach.\n",
      "Ironhack provides high-impact, condensed educational experiences with one objective in mind – getting students from zero to job ready in three months. Because of this, we believe there will always be a gap in the market where we can provide value. Regardless, we are working hard to make it easier for students to have access to our programs by providing financing options through both private and public channels.\n",
      "What will make Ironhack stand out amongst the competition in Berlin?\n",
      "We are laser-focused on one objective: enabling students to secure a job within three months after graduation.\n",
      "So how do we achieve that? Well, first we make our students employable. We constantly update our curriculum to ensure we teach the latest technologies that employers actually demand, and we hire professional instructors with real-world experience to teach them. We provide career guidance and support throughout the whole program, and students are prepared for technical interviews, behavioral interviews, etc. We believe in learning by doing, so students come out with three projects to show to the world once they’ve graduated.\n",
      "We also focus on giving our students access to those opportunities, by securing hiring partners and organizing a career week where students get to meet prospective employers at the end of each cohort.\n",
      "What types of applicants are you looking to enroll in the Berlin campus?\n",
      "We're looking for career changers. There are so many talented people in Berlin who have moved here looking for opportunities. Ironhack gives you the possibility to specialize and land a job in three months. We cater to anyone who realizes the importance of learning new digital skills and has a passion to learn.\n",
      "How many students does Ironhack plan to accommodate at the Berlin campus?\n",
      "We're going to have three cohorts in 2018. The first one starts in May, the second one in July and the third one in October. For the first cohort, we're looking at about 20 students. We don't like to have cohorts much bigger than that because we want to guarantee quality. Moving forward we will look to grow our team and number of cohorts, always ensuring students have the best possible experience.\n",
      "How do you source new instructors? What will be the instructor: student ratio?\n",
      "We hire real professionals who have worked in the tech industry. Our lead instructor for Berlin was working at the Ironhack Paris campus as the lead instructor for a year and he wanted to move to Berlin. He's one of those people who has been coding his whole life. He started his own company, and he's worked in the industry as a lead developer – he has a very impressive background. And he already knows the Ironhack bootcamp and our course, so that's always a plus.\n",
      "At Ironhack, a lead instructor leads the whole program, and then we have teaching assistants, who are also coding professionals, for every eight students, to provide support and guide students through the course. For example, in the first cohort, if we have 20 students, we would have one lead instructor and two or three teaching assistants. Having gone through the bootcamp myself, I feel the teaching assistants play an incredibly important role because they provide valuable assistance throughout the whole bootcamp.\n",
      "Will the curriculum at Ironhack Berlin be the same as other Ironhack campuses?\n",
      "Ironhack’s current curriculum is divided into three modules: Front-end (HTML, CSS & Javascript), Backend MEAN Stack, and Microservices with Angular 2 (API’s). We are always looking to make our curriculum better. We were teaching Ruby on Rails, but we decided to move on to . Also, something I always tell prospective students is that you learn how to learn. I graduated from the Ruby on Rails course and was able to learn Node.js on my own just the next month.\n",
      "We're in contact with a lot of startups, so we make sure our curriculum is exactly what employers need and demand. We make a point to keep the curriculum consistent across all campuses. This allows us to have a feedback loop at every campus and ensure consistent quality. So we’re sticking with the same curriculum in every campus for now, but always looking to iterate and make it better.\n",
      "Tell us about the Berlin campus. What is the classroom like?\n",
      "As with most of our new campuses, we'll be located at a WeWork co-working space, a new building called Atrium Tower right on Potsdamer Platz. The space itself is a big room which holds around 40 students. When we visited the space about a month and a half ago, we fell in love with the facilities. The campus is accessible from anywhere in town because of its central location, and it has an incredible terrace at the top.\n",
      "When you're going to be learning for three months in an incredibly intense program, being in a nice space with amenities – coffee, snacks, really nice views – is something really important.\n",
      "What are some examples of the types of jobs you envision your Berlin graduates landing after bootcamp?\n",
      "We have a very strong reputation worldwide, with a global community of alumni and partners. For example, we just signed up N26, a mobile bank to be our hiring partner. We’re in talks with several Berlin companies to sign them up as hiring partners too. At the end of each nine-week course, we prepare prospective employers to meet with the students. Like I said, we're very focused on career changers and ensuring our students get a job within three months after graduation.\n",
      "In the past, we've had companies like Google, Twitter, Visa, Rocket Internet, and Magic Leap hire Ironhack graduates. So in Berlin we're looking for the same profiles. Those are global companies we already have partnerships with, so our students already have access to that pool of employers. Then locally, we are looking for the most disruptive companies that are ready to hire entry-level junior developers.\n",
      "Do you envision Berlin grads staying in Berlin? Is your focus to get people hired in the city where they studied?\n",
      "We have a big focus on having a global community. So we really like the idea that our students can access all the communities in all our cities. For example, I recently passed on the resumes of two graduates from the Madrid UX/UI course to Berlin-based N26. It’s up to each graduate to decide which city to work in.\n",
      "A lot of people want to stay in their home city and others don't, so we cater to both. We try to give opportunities to go abroad, and options to work in the local market.\n",
      "What would you recommend a complete beginner do to learn more about the tech scene in Berlin?\n",
      "I would recommend going to as many meetups and events as you can. I always tell people that you never know what opportunities could arise if you put yourself out there, and start talking to people. We actually just wrote a blog post about How to Land the Tech Job in Berlin, and one piece of advice is to mingle. Just network.\n",
      "Then, of course, I would recommend going to the Ironhack meetups. There are a bunch of workshops in Berlin and our informal network is huge. We're doing one free workshop every week and we'll do some bigger events as well.\n",
      "What advice do you have for someone who's thinking about attending a coding bootcamp in Berlin and considering Ironhack?\n",
      "Form my experience as an alum, I think it's all about the attitude. When you go into a coding bootcamp, there's always this feeling where you're a little bit scared because it is something really demanding. People have a natural tendency to be resistant to learn something so technical. But just start coding! It's not as difficult as it may seem, and having the right guidance is key. We’re actually launching a cool challenge in Berlin - a free online course to encourage people to get their feet wet with coding.\n",
      "A lot more people than we believe have the aptitude for it, and actually become really good programmers. You just have to take a leap of faith and commit to three months of very intense work. We have a 90% placement rate and while we do have a rigorous admissions process, the majority of our students get hired. I recommend people to just go for it. I can guarantee that if you have the right attitude, you'll succeed.\n",

      "\n",
      "Global Tech School Ironhack is launching a new campus in Mexico City on January 15, 2018. We spoke with Ironhack’s VP of Operations & Expansion, Alexandre Berriche, to learn about the Mexico City tech ecosystem and why there is a growing demand for developers in the area. This school uses feedback from their campuses around the world to continually improve the curriculum. Discover how Ironhack can connect you to a 1000+ network of alumni, help you with job placement, and get some tips for your application!\n",
      "Q&A\n",
      "What's your background? What drew you to want to work with Ironhack?\n",
      "After starting my career in Private Equity, I joined Jumia,a Rocket Internet company, also called the African Amazon. I was Head of Operations in North Africa and then Managing Director of Tunisia.I got in touch with Ariel and Gonzalo, the founders of Ironhack, and was really inspired by their vision. Also, since I actually attended a coding bootcamp myself, I was excited to come and work in this industry. I saw the great potential the bootcamp model had in Europe and also Latin America. I was keen to have an impact on people’s lives, so I was super receptive to our conversation and working with Ironhack. It was a great fit.\n",
      "As the VP of Expansion, can you describe your role?\n",
      "As VP of Expansion, I work with the founders to create a strategy and decide which markets make sense for us to open in next. Then I'm involved with the operations preparation where I actually launch the new markets.\n",
      "There are three main areas to consider when launching in a new market. The first is human resources – we want to build an awesome team including a general manager. We were super excited to find a great GM for our Mexico campus. Marketing and brand awareness is number two. When you're launching in a new market, you want to increase the brand awareness and convince your first students of the benefits of the new campus. It can be difficult in a new market because we are starting from scratch, so we have to leverage the use of marketing channels such as public relations, events, and partnerships to integrate ourselves into the local ecosystem. The third area is legal – making sure the legal administration is completed. If you succeed in those three areas, you are ready to open in any market.\n",
      "What stood out about Mexico City? Why did Ironhack choose to open a campus there?\n",
      "We are one of the leaders in the coding bootcamp industry globally, and we’ve been thinking about opening in Latin America for quite some time. Latin America is a great market because there is so much demand for tech skills, but there is a limited number of established bootcamps in the area. In 2019 it is estimated there will be a deficit of 150,000 IT jobs in Mexico, so we can have a great impact on that. We want to train the new generation of technology professionals to join the industry. Not many, if any, bootcamps have campuses in the U.S., Europe, and in Latin America, so Latin America was very attractive to us.\n",
      "Mexico City was the preferred choice because it has a booming tech ecosystem. It's one of the largest markets for startups. Mexico City is the entry for many tech companies moving to Latin America – Facebook, Amazon, and so on – so many tech multinationals are moving in.  The ecosystem is not just booming, it's also maturing significantly well as there are plenty of VC’s, accelerators, and company builders.\n",
      "Finally, it's a pretty friendly environment for internet technology and computer science. It's a big market to penetrate, but it's less difficult than some other markets because there are no global competitors. There are obviously some local competitors, whom we respect a lot, but we are going to give the Mexico City ecosystem access to Ironhack’s global community which is already present in Miami, Paris, Barcelona, and Madrid. We think building ties within those markets will excite students learning in Mexico City.\n",
      "There are only a few bootcamps in Mexico City. How will Ironhack stand out once other bootcamps start to pop up?\n",
      "Ironhack will stand out because we are global. We have already learned so much about running a bootcamp, because each market we operate in has different standards and different challenges. So by bringing this experience into the market, we are raising the coding bootcamp standards for Mexico City. Ironhack has graduated 1,000 students, so we have a large community. We have alumni working for Amazon, Google, and IBM, which is a big plus. We have great reviews on Course Report, and we have great student satisfaction for our curriculum. Over the four years we have been operating, we have continued to improve our teaching methods.\n",
      "What is the Ironhack Mexico City campus like?\n",
      "Our offices are at the WeWork Insurgentes coworking space, and it's amazing to work alongside different Mexico City startups and see how dynamic the space is. It’s super exciting. We’re in the Colonia Napoles, which is like a district of startups. At WeWork we take up two rooms of 20 x 30 feet each which hold between 15 to 20 students. We will start with one class, and then eventually have two classes rolling at the same time – one UX/UI design course, and one web development course.\n",
      "Our objective at Ironhack is not quantitative, it's more qualitative so we are not going to accept students if they don't have the required technical level. We are selective with students and we don't accept everyone.\n",
      "Could you describe the Ironhack application process? Is it the same across campuses?\n",
      "Yes. We have two interviews – one personal interview and one technical interview. You can make it through the technical interview even if you don't have tons of knowledge, but you must be a hard worker. If you prepare your case, you can make it in, but we want to be selective.\n",
      "Before the bootcamp starts we also have pre-work and the objective is to have everyone at the same knowledge level when we start the course. People are spending a lot of time and money to really improve, so the courses are very intensive for that reason.\n",
      "Ironhack teaches UX/UI design and web development. Will you be teaching the same curriculum in Mexico City?\n",
      "We collect feedback in each market, and with each piece of feedback we receive, we improve our curriculum little by little. We trust and use the same curriculum in every market. You can’t scale efficiently if you have each market doing different classes. The feedback loops in all the different markets allow us to have the best quality program. I don’t think we could have the best quality if we made too many specificities for the various cities.\n",
      "How many instructors will you have at the Mexico City campus?\n",
      "The number of instructors will grow as the number of students and the number of classes increase. For instance, at the Paris campus, four months after launching we had seven teachers. It will be the same for Mexico. So we’ll start with one instructor and then after a few months, seven, and after one year maybe 10 – we're going to see how fast it grows.\n",
      "Since Ironhack is a global bootcamp, how do you help with the job search and placement? What sort of jobs do you expect graduates to get?\n",
      "We are trying to build partnerships with Linio, TIP, and many Mexican startups where we can place our students. Companies will be invited to Hiring Week at the end of the bootcamp to see what type of talent we produce. We’ll start by targeting companies in Mexico City and then we’ll expand and make partnerships with companies in Guadalajara and Monterrey as a second step.\n",
      "Most of our graduates become junior developers. We have less entrepreneurs and more junior developers. Ironhack focuses on career changers and trying to help them to achieve their ambitions so that’s why we are so focused on placement with Iron Week, and a placement manager in each market.\n",
      "Is it pretty normal for graduates to stay in the city where they studied?\n",
      "We are seeing graduates stay in the city where they studied, unless they’re coming from abroad. We have a few international students and currently, most of them go to the Barcelona and Paris campuses. We don't know about Mexico City graduates yet, but most of our applications so far are from Mexico – with some international applicants as well.\n",
      "If someone is a beginner and thinking about attending a coding bootcamp in Mexico City like Ironhack, do you have any meetup or event suggestions?\n",
      "Yes, Ironhack is doing a huge full-day event at WeWork on December 9th. Anyone can attend and it’s free. This is a great opportunity to learn about tech, discover the Mexico City ecosystem and decide if you want to apply to Ironhack.\n",
      "What advice do you have for people thinking about attending a coding bootcamp like Ironhack?\n",
      "The first thing is, it’s an amazing commitment, and if you are applying for good reasons and have the technical ability, you will be accepted and get the best experience. It's a once in a lifetime experience to spend nine weeks changing your career. You will learn so much, meet new companies, and get hired. If you want to learn more, go to the Ironhack website, download the application guide, and come to some events. We have a Meetup group and Facebook page. You can read plenty of reviews of the school on Course Report. If you are sure of your motivations, you are a hard worker, and you’re committed, I'm sure you will be accepted.\n",
      "Do you have any additional comments about the Ironhack’s new Mexico City campus?\n",

Course Report has just what you need! We’ve put together the most important news and developments in this blog post and podcast. In July, we read about the closure of two major coding bootcamps, we dived into a number of new industry reports, we heard some student success stories, we read about new investments in bootcamps, and we were excited to hear about more diversity initiatives. Plus we round up all the new campuses and new coding bootcamps around the world.Continue Reading →Campus Spotlight: Ironhack ParisLauren Stewart5/26/2017Ironhack\n",
      "Ironhack is a global web development bootcamp with locations in Madrid, Miami, Barcelona, and now Paris! We spoke with Ironhack’s General Manager for France, François Fillette, to learn more about their new Paris campus, launching June 26th. France is the second largest tech ecosystem in Europe – learn why Ironhack chose to expand to the area, read how the bootcamp will stand out from the rest, and see what resources are available to become a successful bootcamp grad in Paris.\n",
      "First, as the France General Manager, tell me how you’ve been involved with the new Ironhack campus.\n",
      "Sure! As a General Manager, I have been involved in all the dimensions related to the new campus – finding an amazing place for our students, recruiting a team of A-players, setting up the docs and processes and so on. I have been working with Alex, our Head of International Expansion, who has been tremendously helpful. We have worked super hard over the last few weeks to make sure that our Paris campus will be on the same standards as the others.\n",
      "What’s your background and how did you get involved with bootcamps? What drew you to want to work with Ironhack?\n",
      "I was coming back from San Francisco, where I was working as VP of Strategy and Business Development for CodinGame. One of my VC friends told me that Ariel and Gonzalo (the cofounders) were looking for someone to launch Ironhack in France. I met the two of them and immediately embraced their vision, and got impressed by their ability to execute fast and well. I got super excited by the project and the team, so a couple of days later I was in Miami to work on the strategy and the launch plan for France! It’s been 3 months now and honestly, I’ve never been happier to wake up in the morning and start a new day!\n",
      "Ironhack is launching their Paris campus on June 26th. Why is Paris a great place for a coding bootcamp? Could you explain Ironhack’s motivation to expand there?\n",
      "In terms of funding, France is now the 2nd largest tech ecosystem in Europe, right after England. Over the last 5 years, it has grown exponentially and is now one of the key tech hubs in the world. Take Station F for instance – thanks to Xavier Niel (cofounder of Free), Paris will now have the biggest incubator in the world. That growth has fueled an increasing demand for new skills in the tech economy and the talent shortage is not filled by the traditional education players. There’s an amazing opportunity for us to expand here and we’ll do everything we can to reach our targets.\n",
      "There are a few other coding bootcamps in Paris. What will make Ironhack stand out amongst the competition?\n",
      "Several initiatives and players have appeared over the last couple of years, which shows you how dynamic the market is. I think 3 elements will set Ironhack apart from the competition. First, our courses are focused on the latest technologies – for example, full-stack Javascript for Web Development – and we constantly iterate to improve both the content and the academic experience. Then, we dedicate a large share of the course (60-70%) to hands-on, real-life applications. Students work on real projects, submitted by partners or by themselves if they want to create their startup/business. Last, we help with the placement of our students if they’re looking for a job (coaching for technical and behavioral interviews, connections to companies/startups, events, etc.). We have an average placement rate of 90% after 3 months across our campuses.\n",
      "Let’s discuss the Paris campus. What is the classroom like? What neighborhood is it in?\n",
      "The campus is located in the new space opened by WeWork. It is located in the 9th arrondissement, near the Paris Opera. It is accessible via 3 metro lines, 8 bus lines, 2 bike-sharing stations, and 2 car-sharing stations. It will be open 24/7 for our students.\n",
      "The place is absolutely magnificent, both in terms of design and community. Students will enjoy a large classroom close to the patio, and meeting/working rooms to complete their projects and assignments.\n",
      "What web development and UX/UI design tracks or languages are you teaching at this campus and why? Are the ones you’ve chosen particularly popular or relevant in Paris?\n",
      "The core curriculum is the same across the different campuses to make sure students have the same academic experience and that we have a strong expertise in our area. Then we tailor the mentors, the events and the projects to the local specificities of the students and of the ecosystem. So, for Web Development, we’ll be focusing on full-stack Javascript but we’ll be integrating events and mentors around frameworks really popular here (ex: React or Meteor) and industries that are the rising trends (ex: online media and entertainment).\n",
      "How many instructors and/or mentors will you have in Paris?\n",
      "We’ll have a lead instructor, who is a professional developer and highly involved in the open source community. He has several years of experience in startups and IT services agencies. He’ll be assisted by a TA, who is a bit more junior, but passionate about education and teaching students. Plus, we’ll have a network of 15-20 mentors to help and coach students, for coding as well as for management. Mentors will be chosen based on the projects of the students. Also, the students of the first Web Development session will be sponsored by Florian Jourda. Florian was the 1st engineer at Box and scaled their dev team from 2 to 300 people. He spent 8 years in the Silicon Valley and is now Chief Product Officer at Bayes Impact, an NGO funded by Google that uses machine learning to solve social problems like unemployment.\n",
      "How many students do you usually have in a cohort? How many can you accommodate?\n",
      "For that first cohort, we plan to have 20 students maximum because we want to make sure we provide the best experience. That will ensure a strong monitoring of students, as well as a perfect operational execution on our side. For the next cohorts, we’ll increase the number of students, but we won’t go above 30 and we’ll recruit 1 or 2 more TAs to keep the same quality.  \n",
      "What kind of hours will students need to put in to be successful?\n",
      "Students often ask that question and it’s always hard to answer. Everything depends on their learning curve. On average, students work between 50 to 70 hours a week, mainly on projects and assignments. But we’re fully transparent on this – you can’t learn real hard skills and get a job in 3 months without fully dedicating yourself. We make sure that the atmosphere is as good as it can be so that students won’t see time passing by!\n",
      "How is your campus similar or different to the other Ironhack campuses?\n",
      "I think that our campus is pretty similar to Miami’s. We are located in an amazing coworking space, in a very nice neighborhood and with lots of startups around. The main difference would be our rooftop on the 8th floor of the building, where we regularly organize events and lunches.\n",
      "How are you approaching job placement in a new city? Does Ironhack have an employer network already?\n",
      "Job placement is one of the elements we tailor to the local realities and needs. We have already partnered with +20 tech companies, such as Drivy (world leader in peer-to-peer car rental), Jumia (the equivalent of Amazon in Africa and Middle East), Stootie (Europe leader in peer-to-peer services), Kima Ventures (VC fund of Xavier Niel, with +400 portfolio companies), etc. Usually, they are large startups (from Series A to Series D) looking to hire web developers. As a GM, it will be part of my job to support and help students accomplish their professional projects with our employer partners.\n",
      "What types of companies are hiring developers in Paris and why types of companies do you expect to hire from Ironhack’s Paris campus?\n",
      "I think there are 3 types of companies that could hire web developers who graduated from Ironhack – corporations in Telecom/Media/Technology, startups (from Series A to series D) and IT services companies. The demand is really intense for the last two options, as they’re looking for people mastering the latest technologies, in high volumes. Based on the enthusiasm they’ve expressed when talking with Ironhack, we know they’ll be great recruiting partners.  \n",
      "What sort of jobs have you seen graduates get at other Ironhack campuses and what do you expect for Ironhack Paris graduates? Do they usually stay in the city after graduation?\n",
      "Based on the metrics of other campuses, usually, 50-60% of people join a startup as an employee (a Junior Web Developer, Project Manager or Growth Hacker). 20-30% create their own startup after the course, while 20-30% become freelancers, usually in Web Development, and work on a remote basis. We’ll have a good share of students who are not from France originally, so we think some of them might leave Paris after the course. But we’ll help them find the right opportunity abroad and we’ll keep constant interaction with those students.\n",
      "What meetups or resources would you recommend for a complete beginner in Paris who wants to get started?\n",
      "France has some great players in the field. If you want to get an intro to Javascript, I would recommend you visit OpenClassrooms, Codecademy or CodeCombat. Then, in terms of meetups, The Family and NUMA are two accelerators with outstanding weekly events. Some of them are related to one specific coding topic and they’re usually apprehended at a beginner level.\n",
      "Any final thoughts that you’d like our readers to know about Ironhack Paris?\n",
      "We want to build something that is nothing like what exists in Paris. In 3 months, you’ll be operational in Web Development, you’ll meet awesome people (students, mentors, entrepreneurs) and you’ll accomplish your professional project. Send us an email to know more at paris@ironhack.com. We have a few seats left for the session starting on June 26th. Next session will start on September 4th. If you want to apply, just send us your application through this typeform.\n",

      "\n",
      "Miami coding bootcamp Ironhack recently launched an intensive course in UX/UI Design, where students learn everything they need to know about user research, rapid prototyping, user testing, and front-end web development to land their first job in UX design. We sat down with instructor (and UX superstar) Jacqueline Pastore on their first day of class to find out what makes a great UX/UI Designer (think: listening skills, empathy and communication), how the school produces User Experience Unicorns by incorporating HTML/Bootstrap skills into the curriculum, and the teaching style that future students can expect at Ironhack Miami.\n",
      "Q&A\n",
      "How did you become a successful UX Designer? Did you get a degree in “UX Design?”\n",
      "I’m a career changer! My background was first in film and creative writing, and I worked in the film industry in Miami before I ended up in Boston, temping as a project manager for a venture capital company with an incubator focused on Harvard and MIT startups. I learned from really smart people about computers, software, graphic design, and project management; and IBM had their Lotus Notes usability labs next door, so I got to participate as a usability tester. I went back to grad school at Bentley University for my Masters in Human Factors in Information Design, and had a magical career doing ethnography and user research at Microsoft, Staples, Adidas, and Reebok, and UX design for Fidelity Investments, Staples, the Federal Reserve, JP Morgan Chase, H&R Block, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, and Zumba Fitness.\n",
      "Two years ago, I moved back to Miami and started my own product, UX Gofer, which is a UX research tool.\n",
      "After spending years learning User Experience and even getting a Masters degree, why do you believe in the bootcamp model as an effective way to learn UX Design?\n",
      "I went through my grad program very quickly (in one year), so I believe that you can learn this material very quickly and then continue learning on the job. That’s exactly why I’ve had a successful career, by specifically going after different verticals, technologies, and platforms. If I hadn’t used something before, I wanted to try it. I believe that you can learn the fundamentals quickly and then refine them throughout your career.\n",
      "What made you excited to work at Ironhack in particular- what stands out about Ironhack to you as a professional UX Designer?\n",
      "It was the people. I was referred to Ironhack by someone I’ve respected in the industry for years, and they were right. The people running Ironhack are what convinced me to work on this UX Bootcamp.\n",
      "Did you have teaching experience prior to teaching at the bootcamp? What is different about teaching at a coding bootcamp?\n",
      "I teach now at the University of Miami, at conferences, and bootcamps. At Ironhack, my personal teaching style is to lecture very little, and focus on hands-on work. It’s important to know the foundations and principles and science behind what we do, but at the end of the day, you have to deliver. So we spend the majority of our days doing activities, which means running surveys, doing interviews, running usability tests, designing products. I think it’s so important for students to create their portfolio pieces throughout the bootcamp, instead of just having one portfolio project at the end of the course. For someone breaking into the UX community, the portfolio is how students demonstrate their knowledge and how they approach projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is Ironhack’s first foray into UX/UI design courses! Tell us about the curriculum.\n",
      "Marcelo Paiva and I created the Ironhack curriculum based on what we would have wanted to learn in a bootcamp if we were to just get started in this field. We follow the user and product development lifecycles to make sure that our students have all the skills they need to be useful right now in the current marketplace.\n",
      "We start with user research – how to talk to your target market, the methodology behind that research, what to do with that data, deliverables, and turning that data into concept design.\n",
      "We move into information architecture and interaction design, with low-fidelity all the way into high-fidelity, and micro interaction models. We use Invision, Sketch, and Principal as the tools for that piece of the curriculum. Then we move into visual design for mobile and web, because they are two different beasts.\n",
      "Then we move into front-end development, where students learn how to implement the designs they’re creating. This is what the industry is looking for right now: the unicorns that can do the HTML and bootstrap to implement their own designs. That will make Ironhack students really effective and marketable.\n",
      "Finally, we move into individual projects. Ironhack students are building portfolio pieces from Day One, but towards the end of the course, they work on more specific projects and breakouts for additional topics that we haven’t covered yet.\n",
      "I’m so super excited about this bootcamp and I think it’s really valuable.\n",
      "Is the push for designers to learn to code the biggest trend in the UX/UI field right now?\n",
      "It depends on where our graduates choose to work. As part of a smaller team, a UX Designer will have to be more of a generalist, and need to do research, design, and development. If they’re working for a larger organization, they can specialize in a particular field within UX like ethnography, or mobile design, or design thinking. As a whole, I think careers in the UX community are becoming both broader and more specialized. The UX community is both coming together and breaking into niches.\n",
      "How many instructors, TAs, and/or mentors do you have? Is there an ideal student:teacher ratio?\n",
      "The student:teacher ratio for the UX/UI course is 10:1. Many of the required activities are tackled in groups among the students in groups of 3 or 4. As the principal instructor, I lead and teach the main flow of the course, and we have subject matter experts and mentors come in to teach sections of the curriculum that are more specialized e.g. design thinking, front-end development, etc.\n",
      "Can you tell us a little bit about the ideal student for Ironhack’s UX/UI Design Bootcamp? What’s your class like right now? And how do the UX students differ from the coding bootcamp students?\n",
      "The ideal student for the UX/UI Design Bootcamp is someone who possesses strong communication skills, can use empathy to jump into other people’s shoes, and has a passion for user-experience. The current class is a wonderful mix of many professional backgrounds: for example, some profiles include a former Marketing Manager for Sony Music, a Research Director from the non-profit space, and an MBA grad looking to use their previous Business Process skills to crack into the UX sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a full-time bootcamp, but how many hours a week do you expect your students to commit to Ironhack Miami?\n",
      "In addition to the daily schedule of 9am to 6pm, we expect students to spend approximately 20 hours outside of class time to work on assignments and projects- so about ~65 hours/week.\n",
      "In a UX bootcamp, is the style largely project based? Can you give us an example?\n",
      "Yes, students will work on 2 projects during the first 6 weeks (one individual project and one group project). These projects are a sum of the individual units we cover on a week-by-week basis. The capstone of the course is a 2-week final project that each student completes individually, as they go through the entire user and product development lifecycles. The result at the end of the course is that each student has 3 prototypes that they can use as portfolio pieces moving forward.\n",
      "What’s the goal for a student that graduates from Ironhack (in terms of career and ability)? For example, will they be prepared for a junior UX/UI role? A senior role?\n",
      "The goal of this course is to provide students the skills to carry out a UX/UI design process from beginning to end in multiple circumstances with varying goals. As a result, students will be prepared for junior and entry-level roles in UX/UI fields, depending on which part of that process most interests them.\n",
      "For our readers who are beginners, what resources or meetups do you recommend for aspiring bootcampers in Miami?\n",
      "We hold open houses and free introductory workshops to coding and design monthly, which can be found on the Ironhack Meetup page. Our friends at IxDA also offer some cool workshops on Meetup.\n",
      "We also really love the free Hack Design course which is a fantastic resource for someone who wants to delve more into this world!\n",
      "Is there anything else that you want to make sure our readers know about Ironhack’s new UX/UI Design Bootcamp?\n",
      "If you have any more questions about the course, coding, or Ironhack in general, please e-mail us at admissionsmia@ironhack.com. We’d be happy to help you figure out what next steps might work best for your profile and individual goals!\n",

From students looking for free coding bootcamps to those wondering if an $18,000 bootcamp is worth it, we understand that cost is important to future bootcampers! While the average full-time programming bootcamp in the US costs $11,906, bootcamp tuition can range from $9,000 to $21,000, and some coding bootcamps have deferred tuition. So how do you decide what to budget for? Here, we break down the costs of coding bootcamps from around the USA. This is a cost comparison of full stack (front end and back end) in-person (on-site) immersive bootcamps that are nine weeks or longer, and many of them also include extra remote pre-work study. We have chosen courses which we think are comparable in course content – they all teach HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, plus back end languages or frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, Python, Angular, and Node.js. All schools listed here have at least one campus in the USA.

      "\n",
      "Ironhack is an immersive iOS and Web Development bootcamp that started in Spain and has now expanded to Miami. With a hiring network and happy alumni, Ironhack is a great Florida bootcamp option. But what exactly does it take to get into Ironhack? We caught up with the Ironhack team to learn everything you need to know about the Ironhack application and interview process, including how long it will take, their current acceptance rate, and a sneak peek at the questions you'll hear in the interview. \n",
      "The Application\n",
      "How long does the Ironhack application typically take?\n",
      "The Ironhack application process falls into 3 stages (the written application, first interview, and second technical interview) and takes on average, 10-15 days to complete in entirety.\n",
      "What goes into the written application? Does Ironhack require a video submission?\n",
      "The written application is a chance for students to give a quick summary of their background and motivations for wanting to attend. It’s their opportunity to tell us about themselves in a nutshell and peak the admission committee’s interest.\n",
      "What types of backgrounds have successful Ironhack students had? Does everyone come from a technical background?\n",
      "We are impressed and inspired by the diversity of students that Ironhack attracts. We’ve had former flight attendants, world-travelling yoginis, and CS grads from Ivy Leagues all attend Ironhack. We’ve been amazed at how coding is so democratic and attracts all sorts of people, regardless of educational background or pedigree. Those who tend to perform the best at Ironhack are those who have committed to doing so, not necessarily those with a technical background.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Interview\n",
      "Can you give us a sample question from the “first interview?”\n",
      "“What motivates you on a day-to-day basis and what do you love to do?”\n",
      "Can you give us a sample question from the “technical interview?”\n",
      "“What happens when you put a function inside a loop?”\n",
      "What are a few resources that you suggest applicants use to really ace the technical interview?\n",
      "When an applicant is in the midst of our process, we actually send them materials specifically to prepare for the technical interview and set office hours with our Teaching Assistants, so they can get some one-on-one time to address specific questions. Apart from that, If they already have some experience programming: https://autotelicum.github.io/Smooth-CoffeeScript/literate/js-intro.html. We recommend this resource for complete beginners: JavaScript for Cats: http://jsforcats.com/\n",
      "How do you evaluate an applicant’s future potential? What qualities are you looking for?\n",
      "Ironhack’s application process reveals a lot of qualities in potential candidates because it is a bit longer than most coding schools. The advantage of this is, it allows us to see how candidates and applicants respond to learning material in a short amount of time, and how dedicated they are to their goals. If they can’t even complete the interview process, it’s an indicator that they might not have the passion or drive to get through 8 weeks of a coding bootcamp! We look for curiosity, passion, and drive. Drive is probably the most important quality to succeed at Ironhack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there a technical coding challenge in the Ironhack Application?\n",
      "Yes!\n",
      "How long should it take? Is there a time limit?\n",
      "We give our students exactly 7 days to prepare for the technical interview after the 1st interview and provide the materials they need to prep for it. The technical interview is led by one of our Miami instructors and consists of a coding challenge that the applicant has 30 minutes to solve.\n",
      "Can an applicant complete the coding challenge in any programming language?\n",
      "The applicant can complete the challenge in whatever programming language they feel most comfortable in as long as that language can solve a breadth of problems. That means that something like CSS is out.\n",
      "Getting Accepted\n",
      "What is the current acceptance rate at Ironhack?\n",
      "As of now, our current acceptance rate is ~20% (23.5%, to be exact!)\n",
      "Are students accepted on a rolling basis?\n",
      "Yes. Spots fill up quickly, so the sooner the applicant gets started, the better.\n",
      "Does Ironhack Miami have a lot of international students since your roots are in Spain? Do international students get student visas/tourist visas to do the program?\n",
      "Yes! We have more than 25 countries represented in our bootcamps globally (e.g. Thailand, Pakistan, Germany, France, Brazil, etc.) The majority of our students who travel to Miami from abroad use a tourist visa to visit the US and attend our program. We love the melting pot of Miami combined with Ironhack’s reputation globally. It’s really a fun place to learn and study!\n",

      " \n",
      "What were you doing before you started at IronHack?\n",
      "I was a freelancer for a year, focused on web front-end development. I worked at an agency before, also for a year. In terms of education, I didn't study anything related to computer science before Ironhack.\n",
      " \n",
      "Did you have a technical background before you applied? \n",
      "I’ve been developing since I was 14, and all that I know is self-taught, and not in any concrete platform, but having projects of my own where the need of learning more every time drove me to get them done.\n",
      " \n",
      "Why did you choose IronHack? Did you apply to any other bootcamps? \n",
      "I chose IronHack basically because it took very good advantage of Google Adwords so I could not avoid reaching its website and getting interested on it. They offered me a merit scholarship so I finally made the decision. I have never applied to anything like IronHack.\n",
      " \n",
      "What was the application process like? \n",
      "The application process was good. The interviews were more of culture-fit and they were not much separated in time with each other, so it took less than a month to have it all approved.\n",
      " \n",
      "What was your cohort like? Did you find diversity in age, gender etc? \n",
      "It was quite good for me. There was clear diversity in age, but not in gender at all, as we were just men. About the level, it was not as fair is it should’ve been, but in general the class was able to follow the course’s process.\n",
      " \n",
      "Who were your instructors? What was the teaching style like and how did it work with your learning style?\n",
      "There were many instructors, so trying to give feedback about all of them would be endless. The teaching style was agile, asking for feedback continuously and adapting the course to it, so it made the experience really enriching. I’ve never had a teaching style like this before and it really fit with me.\n",
      " \n",
      "Did you ever experience burnout? How did you push through it? \n",
      "I did not really experience burnout, but there was a week, when we learned about using Core Data, that I got really tired because it was boring to me. It was the “ugly” side of iOS development, but the professor was so good that I got it all and learned a lot those 5 days.\n",
      " \n",
      "Can you tell us about a time when you were challenged in the class? How did you succeed?\n",
      "For me the challenge was not in a concrete situation, but in following the course’s speed. It was the first time for me to need to learn so fast and so much.\n",
      " \n",
      "Tell us about a project you're proud of that you made during Ironhack. \n",
      "I’m currently working on an app, which is the one I started at IronHack as the final project, but I didn’t have time enough to finish it, so I’m still developing it in collaboration with my partner, who is a Graphic Designer and the one who designed the app. I will provide links as soon as it is released. It is called Snapreminder. Stay tuned! ;)\n",
      " \n",
      "What are you up to today? Where are you working and what does your job entail? \n",
      "I’m working at Rushmore.fm as a Lead iOS developer, building the new application we’ll be releasing soon. I’m currently the only iOS developer, but I’ll lead the team when it grows. I got this job because they contacted me directly.\n",
      " \n",
      "Did you feel like IronHack prepared you to get a job in the real world? \n",
      "It totally prepared me for a real world job. It was worth the money for me. I don’t regret at all.\n",
      " \n",
      "Have you continued your education after you graduated? \n",
      "Not formally, but I keep learning every day and trying to enrich myself. \n",

      "\n",
      "After working at an IT company managing programmers, Jaime Munoz decided that he wanted to learn coding skills, so he enrolled in IronHack, a coding bootcamp in Madrid (with locations in Miami and Barcelona). Jaime tells us why he chose IronHack, the technical and soft skills he learned in his course and the mentors who have helped him along the way.\n",
      " \n",
      "What were you up to before deciding to enroll in IronHack? Did you have a technical background before applying? \n",
      "​Before being a programmer​ I was Project Manager in a big IT company. I hired programmers, and managed their work. After some time I began to be more and more interested in the work those programmers were doing. So much that I decided to quit my job and learn to code. I did a Master's degree of 400 hours in CICE (a IT school in Madrid) with the great luck to have an amazing teacher called Devta Singh. I learned much more than just coding from him. He showed me how to face the problem, find the better solution, and how to succeed on it. It was a personal revelation, and since this moment I knew that I wanted to be a programmer. \n",
      "After the degree I started to work in a digital advertising company called The Fact. We worked for traditional offline advertising companies they needed digital development for his clients. I improved my php and javascript skills there during almost 2 years, but I had the feeling I wasn't improving faster enough. I tried to look for something new to stimulate myself and began to teach coding in a IT academy from Madrid called Trazos, but I needed a change to keep pushing my skills. That's why I turned to IronHack.\n",
      " \n",
      "Was IronHack the only bootcamp you applied to? What about IronHack convinced you to go there (the languages they taught, instructors, price etc)? \n",
      "​IronHack was my first and last choice. Honestly, I didn't knew many bootcamps, but the main reason were the instructors and the great professionals they talked very good about the course. Many of the coders I admire like Keyvan Akbary or Carlos Blé were involved and interested on the bootcamp. This was enough to make the choice.​\n",
      " \n",
      "Can you talk about a time when you got stuck in the class and how you pushed through?\n",
      "​Fortunately I did not got stuck a lot in class, but when I did not understood something I asked for more explanations and I received it immediately and solved the problem.​\n",
      " \n",
      "What were your classmates and instructors like?  \n",
      "​They were all amazing. I guess I was very very very lucky on that point, because all my classmates were amazing. Not only because they were friendly (they really were), but because they were skilled and interested to push like I was.\n",
      "It's amazing when you share such experience with people they think and like the same thinks like you, because it pushed the level very high.\n",
      "The instructors were also great. Very friendly and open to discuss or try whatever we asked for. I think they can't imagine how thankful I am.​ But not only with the teachers or students. Also with Ironhack's staff. They did everything possible to make us receive what we needed.\n",
      " \n",
      "Tell us about your final project! What does it do, what technologies did you use, how long did it take, etc? \n",
      "​For my final project I used Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS and Javascript​, to develop a online medical appointments application. It took a week to have something working and able to be shown in the demo day.\n",
      " \n",
      "What are you working on now? Do you have a job as a developer? What does it entail? \n",
      "​I'm working now in MarketGoo.com (a website marketing and SEO online \"do it yourself\" tool​) as full stack developer. I use PHP, MySQL, HTML5, LESS, Phinx, PHPActiveRecord, JavaScript and other technologies every day, but the key is that I'm not only a developer there. I'm also involved in the product management, collaborating every day in decisions about the product, his look and feel, his behavior and the business itself.\n",
      " \n",
      "Would you have been able to learn what you now know without IronHack? \n",
      "​Maybe I could be able to learn the technical part, but there is no way to learn it in 2 months without a bootcamp. It's just too much information to handle it alone.​ Besides, there is much more than the technical knowledge that you receive in IronHack. You also get a lot of contacts, friends, experience, knowhow and the most important thing: a perspective of what you don't know yet.\n",

      "Marta Fonda needed to improve her web development skills in order to compete for jobs at her dream companies, so she enrolled in IronHack, an 8-week intensive programming course for developers and entrepreneurs. We talk to Marta about how she succeeded in the class and got a job as a front-end engineer at floqq.com!\n",
      "What were you up to before deciding to enroll in IronHack? Did you have a technical background before applying? \n",
      "When I decided to enroll in IronHack I had just finished my degrees in Software Engineering and Business Administration. When I finished my studies I realized that my background in mobile and web development was not enough, so I was looking for an opportunity in a company that would bet on me.  \n",
      "I'm a very motivated person and, in fact, I interviewed with companies like Google and IBM but I did not have enough experience. It was around that time that I found Ironhack bootcamp and I decided to try it.\n",
      "I had technical background as a software engineer but most of my experience programming was based on languages such C, Java or SQL. I needed to improve my skills in order to become a better developer.\n",
      " \n",
      "Was IronHack the only bootcamp you applied to? What about IronHack convinced you to go there?\n",
      "This was the only bootcamp I applied to and the main reason was that they were looking for people like me. Motivated people who had the drive to become a great professional and were only lacking the opportunity to show their potential. They train people in modern languages like Ruby. \n",
      "This was not only an awesome opportunity to learn Rails, but also to be in an environment that is difficult to find in other places. I was learning from the very best professionals and from an incredibly talented group of students.\n",
      " \n",
      "Can you talk about a time when you got stuck in the class and how you pushed through?\n",
      "IronHack is an intensive bootcamp, you must be sure that you are able to push through any problem you have and my classmates were an important point to lean on. On one of my very first days at IronHack I was having trouble understanding one of the concepts that we were covering and it was through teamwork with my other classmates that we were all able to understand it.\n",
      "My classmates were as motivated as me so it was easy to find people to continue programming on weekends or after the class. It was great for me.\n",
      " \n",
      "What were your classmates and instructors like?  \n",
      "In this bootcamp I was surrounded by the very best professionals from all over the country, so I can only say that it was a pleasure to convert their knowledge into mine. Being able to share this experience with my classmates was awesome. If I could have the opportunity to do another Ironhack bootcamp it would be amazing. They are the fastest two months I've ever lived.  \n",
      " \n",
      "Tell us about your final project! What does it do, what technologies did you use, how long did it take, etc? \n",
      "Well, my final project was about a travel application. With this web application you were able to save, organize and share all your trip information. This project was developed in two weeks and in order to achieve all the features that I wanted to include on it, I used Rails. As I wanted to demonstrate all the things that I had learned in IronHack, I decided to include Responsive Web Design (using CSS3) and JavaScript, jQuery and HTML5 functionalities like geolocalization or web storage to improve the user experience.\n",
      "At the end of those two weeks I had a huge frontend project, which was more than I'd ever expected. Thanks to my hard work and efforts in this project I was one of the finalists in the Hackshow (the IronHack final show where the finalists can show what they have made in two weeks) and I could show my project to more than a hundred people.\n",
      " \n",
      "What are you working on now? Do you have a job as a developer? What does it entail?\n",
      "Thanks to the Hackshow two days after the end of IronHack I was working at Floqq.com, the biggest online education marketplace in spanish all over the world. Nowadays, I'm frontend developer and product manager at Floqq.com and I'm working doing what I love to do.\n",
      "IronHack gave me the opportunity that other companies didn't give me. I had no experience and nobody wanted to hire me and now I'm still learning and improving my skills in the best place I could ever find.\n",
      " \n",
      "Would you have been able to learn what you now know without IronHack? \n",
      "It would be impossible to learn what I've learned in IronHack in two months on my own. But it's not only about the development skills that I've improved in those two months, it´s also about the personal skills that I´ve been able to develop and the opportunity to meet the best IT professionals from all around Spain. IronHack was just a 180º experience that changed my whole life, and that allowed me to do what I believe I was born to do.\n",

      "Founder Spotlight: Ariel Quinones of IronHackLiz Eggleston4/21/2014Ironhack\n",
      "\n",
      "IronHack is an 8-week coding bootcamp with campuses in Madrid, Barcelona, and soon, Miami! We talked with cofounder Ariel Quinones about their Rails curriculum, how they attract American students to \"study abroad\" in Spain, and what sets Ironhack apart. \n",
      " \n",
      "Tell us about how IronHack started.\n",
      "I come from a finance background- I’m originally from Puerto Rico, but spent 5 years in New York. My cofounder Gonzalo comes from the construction industry; he’s a civil engineer and he built all sorts of major infrastructure projects in Europe. Having said that, I come from a household of educators. Both of my parents were teachers when I was growing up and my father actually started a private university in Puerto Rico 20 years ago that started with 15 students and now they have 6 campuses and over 10,000 students enrolled.\n",
      "I think education was always a part of my DNA and I wanted to do something after completing my education. I met Gonzalo during our MBA; we were both at Wharton. He also wanted to do something in education in Europe and possibly in ed-tech as well. During those 2 years of the MBA we were iterating ideas, constantly and I think had the same issue that most non-technical founders have in the U.S., which is having brilliant “ideas” but once you get to the point where you need to execute them and produce an MVP, you’re not able to do it. It’s incredibly challenging to find a cofounder and it’s incredibly challenging from a cost and also from an operational perspective to outsource the development.\n",
      "Gonzalo and I took a 2-day course at Wharton where they taught us to do very basic Rails. Even though we didn’t acquire the skills necessary to build our MVP, we were excited about the possibility of teaching both technical and non-technical people these skills through a highly intensive and compressed time period. After that experience, we started looking at the boot camp model. At that point, the earlier ones were starting to get a little bit of traction. We thought it would be interesting to do this somewhere abroad. I’d done a lot of business in Latin America so I had some ties to the region. Gonzalo, my partner is Spanish, so our first bet was Spain.\n",
      " \n",
      "Would you say that IronHack is more geared towards makers or technical cofounders as opposed to people who want to get a job at an established company as a junior developer?\n",
      "We’ve had both profiles. We’ve been selective in the people we admit from a technical background. We’ve been hesitant so far to say “go from total newbie to professional web developer in X weeks.” Our approach is appealing to folks that are maybe already in close touch with technology and code. Developers that want to professionalize their skills and take them to the next level, or people that are very smart, analytical and are looking for a hardcore experience that will allow them to learn from these types of people.\n",
      " \n",
      "When was the first cohort?\n",
      "The first cohort was in October of 2013. Each course is 8 weeks long.\n",
      " \n",
      "What was the biggest lesson that you learned after running your first cohort?\n",
      "One thing we learned is that the 8 weeks just fly by. When you plan for people to be coding 10 to 12 hours a day- that seems like a lot but every day goes by so quickly.\n",
      "The other thing we learned was that no matter how much you filter to make sure you don’t have disparate levels prior to arriving, people just learn differently, at different velocities with different learning styles. So within the structure of 8 weeks we needed different exercises and flexibility to give people the chance to learn right at their own pace, while ensuring that everyone’s learning fundamentals.\n",
      " \n",
      "Do you have students do pre-work before they get to IronHack?\n",
      "Yeah, they do 100 hours of pre-work.\n",
      " \n",
      "What cities are you live in now?\n",
      "We’re live in Madrid and Barcelona and we’re launching in Miami in September.\n",
      " \n",
      "Could you tell us about the tech scenes in the locations that you’re live in- Madrid and Barcelona?\n",
      "People love to come to Spain and study abroad. It’s a country that has a lot to offer from the lifestyle perspective; you know, you have great food, the parties… study abroad in Spain has been an integral part of Spanish society for many years, within the traditional higher education arena. In our case, we’re trying to position Spain in a similar fashion. In the first cohorts we trained a lot of people from Spain, but going forward we want to make it attractive for foreigners to come over and enjoy everything that Spain has to offer and at the same time, learn how to code.\n",
      "Barcelona is very exciting because you have people from all over the world that are launching startups there. Obviously within the EU there’s a lot of mobility; if you’re a European Union citizen, you can go anywhere without any sort of visa requirements. And I think a lot of northern Europeans and people from Germany for instance, love Barcelona for weather reasons, the great beaches, the lifestyle… so a lot of them are coming over to Barcelona to launch their own ventures here. In Barcelona, the tech ecosystem is thriving and it’s very international. There’s a lot of mobile startups that are getting traction over there.\n",
      "Madrid is still very much a cosmopolitan city and we’re seeing a lot of traction in the startup space. It’s obviously an emerging ecosystem, nowhere near Silicon Valley, but we’re seeing early stage companies  get either acquired or go for substantial rounds of financing here in Madrid, which is ultimately a driver for our type of business. Companies need funding to employ engineers and we’re seeing that capital flow to early stage projects.\n",
      " \n",
      "Do you get interest from people in the U.S.?\n",
      "Yes; right now we’re getting a lot of interest from people all over the world, including the U.S. I interviewed a few candidates from the Northeast, we have another student from California who’s enrolling in our June course.\n",
      " \n",
      "Is it possible for someone from the U.S. to complete IronHack and then work in Spain or in the EU?\n",
      "Yes, it’s definitely possible. It’s not as challenging as someone from Europe to go to the U.S. For sure, there’s still costs that the employer has to incur but it has nowhere near the costs and all the red tape that you have to deal with in the U.S.\n",
      " \n",
      "Has IronHack raised any money?\n",
      "No, right now we’re bootstrapped and we want to keep it that way as long as possible.\n",
      " \n",
      "So tell us what programming languages students are mastering at IronHack; tell us about the teaching style.\n",
      "We have two courses that are live right now: Web and Mobile.\n",
      "The Web course is an 8-week course. I’d say on average, students are with us in our offices 10 – 12 hours a day. We cover HTML, CSS and JavaScript on the front end, and then on the back we work with Ruby on Rails and teach a little bit of Sinatra as well. The first 6 weeks we’re teaching those core technologies. And the last 2 weeks, students are working on their own project from scratch. The culmination of the program is a demo day where they present their projects to the community- developers, startup cofounders, that type of audience.\n",
      "I’d say 90% of our content is practical. We’re big believers in the flipped classroom model, so we want to make sure that we reduce the amount of theory time to the extent possible. We get them all the resources, videos and exercises to complete at home prior to arriving here. While they’re here we give them homework and assignments for the weekend so we can reduce that theory time.\n",
      "The technology demands in Spain are very fragmented. It’s not like San Francisco where you can produce a gazillion Ruby on Rails grads every year and they’ll be hired by Rails startups. Here, we’re seeing some demand for Rails startups – but also Python, PHP, etc.\n",
      " \n",
      "Do you expect that after completing your course, a graduate would be able to learn Python or PHP on their own?\n",
      "A hundred percent, and we’re seeing that. Even though love the technologies we work with, we’re not obsessed with them either. To us they’re an instrument to teach good development practices. I think one thing that differentiates us from boot camps is our focus and obsession with good coding practices. We’re obsessed with testing, clean code and good design patterns. We’ve done our job if the student get a good background in technology but more importantly, take away those good coding practices that they apply to whatever language or framework they use.\n",
      " \n",
      "Is the mobile class structured the same way?\n",
      "Same format, exact same structure; slightly higher requirements to be accepted. In order to be accepted into the mobile course, you already have to program with another object-oriented language. Our first course is focused on IOS development.\n",
      " \n",
      "Do you think you’ll ever do an Android course?\n",
      "We’ll probably do Android in the near future.\n",
      " \n",
      "How many students do you have in each cohort?\n",
      "Right now we’ve capped at 20. We can probably go a bit more than that but we don’t want to do more than that.\n",
      " \n",
      "How many instructors do you have per class?\n",
      "We always like to have a ratio of at least 6 students per teacher. So when we have 15 students, we have one main professor and two teaching assistants. Our view is that if we’re going to teach you one technology, we want to make sure that the person that is instructing you is the best, most capable person and is highly specialized in that language.\n",
      " \n",
      "How have you found instructors?\n",
      "We went to the best companies here in Spain and other parts of Europe and basically found the best people there. They work part time for us. It’s very different to have someone who’s fulltime boot camp professor versus someone who is a developer and is teaching at a boot camp for 2 weeks.\n",
      "And also from a recruiting perspective, a lot of our students have been hired by their teachers. Also, our students have a network that goes beyond their peers and the Ironhack staff; they have a network that connects to all these companies that these professors are coming from.\n",
      " \n",
      "You said that potential students should have some vested interest in programming and should have some background and be able to prove that they can really handle the material. What’s the application process?\n",
      "We have a 3-step application process. The first part is a written form that we screen and then we do two 30-minute Skype interviews. The first 30-minute Skype interview is to get a sense of who you are, why you want to do this, and get a sense of is you fit within our culture, and if you have that intrinsic motivation to make the most out of the 400 hours that you have here.\n",
      "We say “Listen; you’re going to be coding Monday through Friday, 10 hours a day and then you’re going to have work every day on Saturday/Sunday…” When I tell them that, we want someone who beams energy and positivity. If they make it through that interview, we have a second round, which is basically to assess technical skills. We’ve actually accepted a bunch of people that have never programmed before, but we want to make sure that you have the motivation and the analytical skill set to be able to catch up prior to arriving to our camp.\n",
      "In some cases, we have people that we think are very smart and incredibly motivated but have never coded in their lives, have never even worked with HTML. We admit them subject to another valuation post that second interview. So we’ll get them to complete 60 hours of pre-work and then see where they are.\n",
      " \n",
      "How does IronHack prepare your graduates to find jobs?\n",
      "The demo day is a great way to showcase our talent to our employers, and you have all sorts of employers there from the founding stage where they haven’t raised any money or are still pre-product, to tech employers who have technical teams and more than 30, 40 employees\n",
      "On top of the core curriculum we have speakers like employers come in during the 8 weeks to present their products and also it serves as an opportunity for them to get in touch with their students and identify potential hiring leads.\n",
      "We also bring in leading HR people from some of our top tech employers here to offer workshops on how to set up your CV, how to optimize your LinkedIn profile, SEO and all these things. And we coach them on how to conduct an interview. Right now we’ve had the luxury of being small so we’re all very involved in the process.\n",
      " \n",
      "Are those companies paying a fee to get into the demo day or are they paying a recruiting fee once they’ve hired someone?\n",
      "Right now we’re not charging employers. We’re focused on placing 100% of our graduates and giving access to great companies (even those that wouldn’t be interested in paying a recruiting fee!).\n",
      " \n",
      "Have you been successful in placing your graduates?\n",
      "We’re starting to place a second cohort but in our first cohort, we placed nearly 100% percent of our graduates. I think in the first cohort we placed 60% of the people 3 week after the first course, and then the rest over the next 2 months.\n",
      " \n",
      "Is the accreditation buzz that’s happening in California anywhere on your radar? Do you get any pressure from the government in Spain or are you thinking about going through the accreditation process when you expand to Miami?\n",
      "We’re definitely going to pay attention to this in Miami. We’re all for it if it helps the student, as long as it doesn’t interfere with the model and doesn’t limit the ability of these institutions to offer education that’s agile and that can adapt to the times and the technologies.\n",
      " \n",
      "Are you planning on expanding beyond Miami anytime soon?\n",
      "I think for the next year or even beyond that, we’re going to focus on Miami and Spain. However, we’re going to use Miami and Spain as hubs for other regions. We’re getting a lot of interest from Latin American Students to come to Spain, so for those who would rather come to Miami because it’s closer, we can offer that as well.\n",

I researched courses/boot camps and ran into Ironhack and decided to dive in and take it’s Full-Time Web Dev course after coming across great reviews/ratings.\n",

You learn for 2 weeks and then immediately are sent off to create a project within a week - repeat again 2 more times after that.

      "The instructor for our Cohort (Nick) was very knowledgeable. The only downside was that it was his first time teaching the course, so it felt like he was also learning as we were all trying to learn something too. Besides that, he was most definitely a great instructor and without his proficiency on the subject, I would not have learned as much as I did. As for the teaching assistants, all three of them were amazing (Sandra, Marcos, Ian). They were all very familiar with the coursework since they were all Ironhack graduates as well. It was extremely helpful having dedicated TA's who were former students helping us because they know the struggle so they WANT to help. There's more than enough help to go around, just make sure to ASK for it when you need it and you won't fall behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "The coursework definitely needed some tweaking on some days, our instructor Nick pushed aside what he felt was wrong and obsolete and taught it the best way he could and it definitely worked out. During the course this was one of my top issues, the curriculum for sure needed an update, but from what I have seen after my time there they are (or already have) taken the steps necessary to do so. Which means they take your feedback seriously and won't brush your input aside.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rest of Ironhack Staff\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the first day I applied and even now the staff at Ironhack hasn’t missed a beat. They have been helpful and there for me with any questions I had. They have an idea as to what they want to do with the course, and they definitely make sure that you receive the best experience possible.

      "Hiring Fair Prep\n",
      "\n",
      "From the first week at Ironhack, you become well acquainted with a man named Brito. Take his advice seriously if your goal is getting a job. He walks you through all the necessary steps to prepare you, such as building your resume, creating your LinkedIn, and lets you know about networking events to attend. He constantly brings in people to give speeches to you weekly. Brito is a great source for help and information so make sure you are constantly checking in with him. Along with all this prep work, you are also creating your portfolio during the course. You create 3 projects (on your own or in a small group) which showcase everything you've learned in the course from beginning to end and is the first step to the building of your portfolio.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hiring Fair Event\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the course, Brito arranges companies to come to Ironhack and sit down with you for interviews. This is a valuable introduction for your first interviews. Eventually, you will be off doing interviews on your own and this hiring fair is a great way to evaluate what you did and didn't do so that ultimately you become more and more comfortable during them. Still, that doesn't mean you shouldn't take these interviews at the hiring fair seriously, definitely come prepared to nail them during the event - people DO get hired out of these. This is what you prepare for, and it helps to prepare for future interviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "Post Ironhack Experience\n",
      "\n",
      "After Ironhack, finding a job (if that is what you are there for) is the next battle. Brito is there with you every step of the way. He holds placements help meetings at Ironhack every other week and is always available for any questions you have. He guides you and reminds you that you must KEEP CODING and KEEP APPLYING. If you slack off on those two steps, the job hunt instantly becomes much harder.  Take your LinkedIn, networking, and resume seriously. Do little projects on your own after the cohort, and make sure your JavaScript knowledge is fresh by doing coding challenges on HackerRank/Codewars because they will help with the technical interviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did not get hired immediately after Ironhack. I applied to around 300+ jobs and only got about two handfuls of phone interviews and in-person interviews. I got hired 3 and a half months after. I never stopped coding, I never stopped applying and I always kept in touch with Brito. This process in itself could feel more stressful than the boot camp, but do not quit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes - you learn a lot at Ironhack and are given great guidance, but no they will not hand you a job. You get everything you need from them and now it’s up to you to put in the work and land it. They are there with you every step of the way. I would 100% do it again, I put my life on hold, invested in myself, pushed through and changed my career into something I felt would be more fulfilling. So far it hasn’t disappointed one bit. Not only do you learn a lot at Ironhack, but you make tons of friends and become part of their great community.\n",

I had an all-around wonderful learning experience. You don't need to have much computer knowledge going into it, because each class has multiple teaching assistants who will be there to help if you fall behind or are struggling to keep up. My class had 3 exceptional TA's, Manuel, Colby, and Adrian, who constantly were able to provide assistance when I ran into trouble, had bugs, or just got lost. They were always nice, patient, and willing to go the extra mile just to make sure I really understood deeply what we were learning, including coming in extra early on the weekends and spending one on one time with me in front of the whiteboard to go over each aspect of what we were learning in detail. I was really impressed with -and grateful for- each of them. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was also very impressed with the professor, Alan. He is an extremely knowledgeable person with a natural aptitude for teaching. Always patient, courteous, and welcoming of questions, feedback and taking time to ask us if we all understood or were running into any problems. What really impressed me most about Alan, is how he would take a little bit of time at the start of each class to go beyond the curriculum and to challenge us with computer science coding challenges, to prepare us to think like computer scientists, and get us ready for the types of questions we would likely see in a coding interview, and explain the different ways to approach the problems, and how to think about them in terms of time complexity or memory management. It was well beyond what I expected from a web development course, and I found these lessons particularly rewarding. Alan has a knack for breaking down complex and abstract concepts into digestible bits and getting the class comfortable enough to try and collectively attempt a solution. *Protip* Always volunteer to try and solve the problems he presents, I noticed the students brave enough to attempt these problems retained information better and walked away with a more solid understanding. If he gives you the marker, get up there and give it your best effort. Go home and research the concepts further. JUST DO IT!  Get a whiteboard, for your house, and write important concepts, objectives, goals, and problem examples from class. This will force your brain to reconcile this new information on a daily basis. You will almost certainly see these types of coding challenges in job interviews, and they're abstract, and frustrating if you are not prepared.\n",
      "\n",
      "After graduation, you'll be counseled by Brito, your career counselor, who is also a very cool, down-to-earth and knowledgeable person. He has some real wisdom to share about the interviewing process, how to construct your resume, and specifically tells you to reach out to him before accepting any job offers. I am really impressed with his insight and willingness to be supportive, helpful, and make sure you land a good starting job, well after graduation. \n",
      "\n",
      "Looking back I am extremely thankful to Ironhack and humbled to have had the opportunity to study with such an awesome class. Everyone from my classmates to the teachers, to the teacher's assistants, to the career counselor have all been an absolute pleasure to deal with. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I was blown away by the Ux/UI students. We (the web dev class) got a chance to work with them in the hackathon (which was a totally awesome experience) and they were very impressive. I legitimately wish I could go take their class as well because they absolutely blew my mind with their systematic methodology, creativity, and organized thought processes. They were amazing. I loved working with them. \n",
      "\n",
      " So to wrap it up, I wholeheartedly recommended Ironhacks web development course. 110%. Actively participate, ask questions, be engaged, help classmates, keep a positive attitude and this bootcamp will be a life-changing event for you as it has been for me. \n",

She eventually tried a free coding course, loved it, and decided to enroll in Ironhack’s web development bootcamp in Barcelona, Spain (taught in English). Dafne tells us how learning to code was both very difficult and very satisfying, how supportive Ironhack was (and still is) for her career, and how much she is enjoying being a Front End Developer in her new job at Everis, a European consulting firm!\n",

      "My career path has been very diverse so far. I’m originally from Austria and I did a bachelor’s degree in multimedia in London and Honolulu, with the aim of working in graphic design and video production, but I found the job opportunities were not the kind of jobs I imagined them to be. Then I did an MBA in Vienna and San Diego to increase my career options and ended up in finance in Barcelona.\n",

      "After three years, I got bored with finance and wanted to figure out what to do with my life.

I enjoyed researching technologies, philosophical aspects of the business, and looking at the direction in which the world is heading.\n",
      "\n",
      "I eventually came across Free Code Camp and enjoyed it a lot. My friends who work in web development told me if I became a web developer, I would be learning for the rest of my life. At first that sounded intimidating, but it made me realize that’s exactly what I want to do with my life – it’s a way to make sure I won’t get bored, I can keep learning, and getting better at what I do. It goes hand-in-hand with my personality because I love to learn and do new things. I think that’s why web development is the right choice for me.\n",

      "You’ve traveled a lot – what made you choose Ironhack in Barcelona, rather than another bootcamp in a different city, going back to college, or teaching yourself?\n",
      "\n",
      "I considered teaching myself, but going to university wasn’t an option – it was between teaching myself and going to the bootcamp. As a beginner, the best way to change careers was to go full-on, and be around professionals – the teachers at Ironhack are very talented, and are professionals who have been in the field for a long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I moved to Barcelona three years ago, and fell in love with the city, so it was clear to me that I wanted to do a bootcamp here. I talked to people about the best technologies and languages to learn, and everyone confirmed that Ironhack had the best full-stack JavaScript curriculum. Barcelona has a good tech atmosphere and a growing startup scene. I’d eventually like to have the flexibility to work remotely, and I think that Barcelona will allow that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the course I did was taught in English. In Barcelona, Ironhack offers one full-time cohort in English, and one full-time cohort and one part-time cohort in Spanish.\n",
      "\n",
      "What was the Ironhack application and interview process like for you?\n",
      "\n",
      "The first part was a personality interview to see if you’re really genuinely interested in doing the course and pursuing a career in web development. After passing that first interview, I was given some very basic coding exercises. After those exercises, I had a technical interview with a teacher assistant, which I passed before getting accepted into Ironhack.\n",
      "\n",
      "What was the learning experience like at Ironhack? What was the teaching style?\n",
      "\n",
      "I have to be honest, it was very very tough for me. This was the first time I had done a course in web development. Ironhack was split into three modules. First we had the basic front end module, which was pretty doable. The second module was back end, which for me was very difficult, then the final module was back end with the Angular framework, which was also demanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hours were very intense. Officially, the hours are 9am to 6pm, like a full-time job, but I don’t remember many days when we actually finished at 6. If you’re at Ironhack, then it’s in your best interest to get as much out of the program as you can.\n",
      "\n",
      "The teaching was also quite intense. I’m 30 now so I had been out of school for many years, and going back to lectures was a lot more demanding than I thought it would be. But as intense as it was, it was also very satisfying. Your character really shows when you’re learning web development – you have to deal with daily frustrations and a lot of challenges, but overcoming those challenges is really rewarding.\n",
      "\n",
      "What was your cohort like?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ironhack was one of the most diverse experiences I’ve ever had. Some of my classmates were 18 and had come straight out of high school, and the oldest guy was in his late 40s. The average person was somebody who had decided to change their career.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were very international. There were around 22 students in my class – four of those students were Spanish, and the rest of them were from all over the world, including Europeans and Latin Americans.\n",
      "\n",
      "What was your favorite project that you built at Ironhack?\n",
      "\n",
      "My favorite project was my first project – I created a game of blackjack with front end JavaScript. Since it was my first project, I felt like I had accomplished something that I never in my life thought I could have accomplished. Of course we got help from the teachers, but it’s quite impressive to see what you, yourself are capable of doing. Before we started the project, I was clueless. I honestly had no idea what I was going to do, how I was going to do it, and I didn’t believe I could do it. But after completing the project, it was really impressive to see what I could get myself to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "How did Ironhack prepare you for job hunting?\n",
      "\n",
      "When I was researching bootcamps, it was really important for me to be able to land a job as soon as possible, and Ironhack pretty much guarantees that almost all alumni who want to find work will find work in the field. Right after bootcamp, we had a hiring day where more than 20 recruiters from tech companies came to the campus to see our work. It was a quick interview where we show them our project, they ask questions, they get to know us, and we get to know the companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sonia, my Careers Adviser, was always getting in touch with companies, and getting my input about what I’d like to do. On top of that, I thought it was amazing that after I landed a job and needed some guidance, one of the TAs still gave me advice and input. Even now, I feel like I can go back to Ironhack and get support any time I need it. I try not to milk it, but they are just so helpful and so caring.\n",
      "\n",
      "So you’ve been working at Everis for 7 months now! Congrats! How did you find the job?\n",
      "\n",
      "Everis did come to Ironhack for the hiring day, but I didn’t get a chance to talk to them because there were so many companies there. So the next day, I contacted them and told them I had missed them, but I wanted to get to know them – I was quite active about reaching out to companies. They replied immediately, I went into the office that same day for an interview. Within two weeks, they called me in for a second interview, and shortly after that I received an offer. I was exhausted after graduating from Ironhack, so I took a month off over the holidays, but about a month into my job search, I was working at Everis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can you tell me about Everis and what you work on there?\n",
      "\n",
      "Everis is a consultancy, so we work on projects with different clients. I’m a Junior Front End Developer, and I work with Angular and Typescript. It’s a purely front end job, which is what I wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m on my second project since I started at Everis. The first project was a web app to help organizations apply for governmental loans. It was a very small, global team – two people in Barcelona, two people in Zaragoza, Spain, and the project manager was based in Brussels, Belgium. For my current project there are four of us and we’re all based in Barcelona, except for the project manager who is based in Zaragoza.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s a huge company, I think there are about 3000 people in Barcelona, and they have branches around the world. The company is very diverse, and the teams are very diverse as well. They have an emphasis on hiring very gender-balanced teams, which is nice; Everis is definitely more gender-balanced than other companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you using the technologies and programming languages at Everis that you learned at Ironhack?\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m working in Angular, which is a framework we covered in the third module of Ironhack. There are always new things to learn in Angular, because Angular is quite complex and always evolving. So I haven’t learned any new languages or frameworks, but I had to learn more about Angular on the job.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ironhack provided us with the tools to be able to teach ourselves new technologies more easily. In the future, I will inevitably need to learn more languages and frameworks. But now I have the right tools to be able to teach myself a lot more easily than before the bootcamp.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since you joined Everis, how do you feel you’ve grown as a front-end developer?\n",
      "\n",
      "In 6 months, I feel like I’ve become a lot more independent, and I’m less afraid of touching the code. In addition, I’ve developed a passion for problems! As weird as that sounds, I enjoy running into problems because I enjoy solving them. It’s very fulfilling. Honestly, I think Ironhack is the best decision I’ve made in my life in terms of academia and career development. I haven’t regretted it once.\n",
      "\n",
      "How has your background in graphic design, finance, and entrepreneurship been useful in your new job as a Front End Developer?\n",
      "\n",
      "Graphic design is very much about trends, and it’s been a long time since I studied it. While there are some aspects of design that still apply, a lot has changed. At Everis, when we get a new project, a lot of the design is given by the client – my job is more about implementing the logic and functions rather than the design itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "My experience working in finance has definitely been useful at Everis. Having experience in a huge corporation definitely helps you work with other people and clients in a professional environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s been the biggest challenge or roadblock in your journey to becoming a Front End Developer?\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes you can get stuck on a problem for a really long time, and you start having to deal with your own frustrations. The more you get frustrated, the more you block your brain and the less you can really think logically. That’s a challenge that I’ve had to learn to deal with, and I’m really learning how to be calm and patient. I wasn’t a patient person before, and I’m now really seeing the results of patience.\n",
      "\n",
      "It sounds like Ironhack has stayed involved in your career – have you kept in touch with other alumni?\n",
      "\n",
      "I was just at Ironhack last week actually and I’m going again soon. A lot of people from my cohort have left, but I’ve gotten to know people from the cohorts before and after mine, and we’ve become quite tight. It’s a very strong community. Whenever Ironhack hosts events, I prioritize them – it’s a very good atmosphere and a great network, and every time I go there I feel like I’m at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "What advice do you have for people making a career change through a coding bootcamp?\n",
      "\n",
      "Just do it. My best advice is to stay calm and be aware that you’re going to reach your mental limits. You’re going to have a hard time, but it’s really worth it and it’s very rewarding. There are going to be times when you’ll want to feel very stupid – don’t! If you can be a master of your emotions, then you have a good path ahead.\n",

      "“Berlin is proving to be an incredible tech ecosystem.” With campuses in Miami, Madrid, Paris, Mexico and Barcelona, Ironhack is launching their web development bootcamp in Berlin, Germany in 2018 to take advantage of the growing tech scene. We spoke with Ironhack’s EMEA Expansion Lead, Alvaro Rojas, about the Berlin campus at a WeWork space, how Ironhack is recruiting lots of local hiring partners, and what sort of jobs Ironhack graduates can expect to get in Berlin. Plus, as an Ironhack grad himself, Alvaro gives advice on where to start as a new coder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q&amp;A\n",
      "\n",
      "What's your background and how did you get involved with Ironhack?\n",
      "\n",
      "My background is in strategy consulting. I studied business in London, and then I worked in strategic consulting for tech startups in Spain and California. I worked for the Embassy of Spain in Los Angeles for a little while, and then I launched my own venture there.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm actually an Ironhack graduate. Working in the tech industry, I had always been interested in learning how to code. So I did some research online and I found Ironhack. I graduated from Ironhack around a year and a half ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "I fell in love with the company’s mission and the community they were creating. You hear some really incredible stories when you're working with people from such diverse backgrounds. After graduating, I kept in touch with Gonzalo Manrique, one of the co-founders, so when they decided to expand in Europe, he contacted me about the EMEA (Europe, Middle Eastern, and Africa) Expansion Lead position. It was a no-brainer for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you attend Ironhack to become a developer or did you just want to pick up coding skills?\n",
      "\n",
      "I wanted to pick up coding skills. I think everybody in the future should become literate in some kind of coding language, even if you’re not planning on working as a developer. Most jobs in the future will require a basic knowledge of programming, and I wanted to stay ahead of the curve. If you work in tech, understanding how software is built is a must, regardless of your position. Eventually, machines will dominate the world and you’ll have to speak their language!\n",
      "\n",
      "You have this unique perspective of actually being a student before working as staff at Ironhack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Absolutely. It's easier for me to explain the benefits behind Ironhack because I've lived through the whole experience. It's really great when we do events and prospective students ask me about Ironhack. The first thing I tell them is, \"Look, I'm an alum, I went through the whole experience. I can tell you everything you need to know, and everything you'll go through.\" It was definitely one of the most challenging and rewarding times in my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tell us about your role at Ironhack.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first step when I started was working with the co-founders and the VP of Ops &amp; Expansion, Alex Berriche, to make a strategy plan for Europe. We had various cities in mind and decided to take a structured approach and rank them according to factors we know to be determinants for success. We finally decided Berlin was clearly the next step for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "After deciding on a city, I move there to set everything up. There are two main areas I’m responsible for. The first is Operations &amp; HR – setting up the legal entity for Ironhack’s new campus, securing financing for our students etc, and getting together a dream team to run the campus.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second key area is marketing. We tailor our strategy to each market. It’s all about understanding the different customer segments and building brand awareness – once people understand our value proposition they’re always convinced. We focus strongly on partnering up with cool companies like N26 or MoBerries, and doing free workshops and events for prospective students. It’s all about getting people excited about learning new digital skills.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our first cohort in Berlin launches May 21, 2018.\n",
      "\n",
      "What stood out about Berlin, Germany? Why is this city a great place for Ironhack to have a campus?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ironhack already has campuses in Europe – Madrid, Barcelona, and Paris – so we want to continue to be present in the strongest tech ecosystems, and Berlin is proving to be an incredible tech ecosystem. Berlin is home to the single largest software market in Europe – that's around a quarter of the European market by value, which is pretty crazy. There are around 2,000 to 2,500 active tech startups here, including some really disruptive companies. The tech ecosystem is booming, and the city has the ability to attract and retain talented people like no other place. People are flocking to Berlin because they like living here and there’s plenty of job opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the IT jobs market in Germany has a growing digital skills gap. There are a lot of new startups that demand developers and designers, along with traditional older companies who are going through a digitalization process. McKinsey released a study saying there would be 100,000 digital jobs in Berlin by 2020, so that was big data point for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since students can go to university for free in Berlin, why would they want to pay to go to Ironhack?\n",
      "\n",
      "Companies are demanding more people with digital skills, and four-year universities just can't cater to that market. Ironhack believes universities, regardless of whether they are private or public, are failing to adapt to the digital revolution. The university approach hasn’t changed in 100 years, and getting a job in this day and age requires a different, updated approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ironhack provides high-impact, condensed educational experiences with one objective in mind – getting students from zero to job ready in three months. Because of this, we believe there will always be a gap in the market where we can provide value. Regardless, we are working hard to make it easier for students to have access to our programs by providing financing options through both private and public channels.\n",
      "\n",
      "What will make Ironhack stand out amongst the competition in Berlin?\n",
      "\n",
      "We are laser-focused on one objective: enabling students to secure a job within three months after graduation.\n",
      "\n",
      "So how do we achieve that? Well, first we make our students employable. We constantly update our curriculum to ensure we teach the latest technologies that employers actually demand, and we hire professional instructors with real-world experience to teach them. We provide career guidance and support throughout the whole program, and students are prepared for technical interviews, behavioral interviews, etc. We believe in learning by doing, so students come out with three projects to show to the world once they’ve graduated.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also focus on giving our students access to those opportunities, by securing hiring partners and organizing a career week where students get to meet prospective employers at the end of each cohort.\n",
      "\n",
      "What types of applicants are you looking to enroll in the Berlin campus?\n",
      "\n",
      "We're looking for career changers. There are so many talented people in Berlin who have moved here looking for opportunities. Ironhack gives you the possibility to specialize and land a job in three months. We cater to anyone who realizes the importance of learning new digital skills and has a passion to learn.\n",
      "\n",
      "How many students does Ironhack plan to accommodate at the Berlin campus?\n",
      "\n",
      "We're going to have three cohorts in 2018. The first one starts in May, the second one in July and the third one in October. For the first cohort, we're looking at about 20 students. We don't like to have cohorts much bigger than that because we want to guarantee quality. Moving forward we will look to grow our team and number of cohorts, always ensuring students have the best possible experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do you source new instructors? What will be the instructor: student ratio?\n",
      "\n",
      "We hire real professionals who have worked in the tech industry. Our lead instructor for Berlin was working at the Ironhack Paris campus as the lead instructor for a year and he wanted to move to Berlin. He's one of those people who has been coding his whole life. He started his own company, and he's worked in the industry as a lead developer – he has a very impressive background. And he already knows the Ironhack bootcamp and our course, so that's always a plus.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Ironhack, a lead instructor leads the whole program, and then we have teaching assistants, who are also coding professionals, for every eight students, to provide support and guide students through the course. For example, in the first cohort, if we have 20 students, we would have one lead instructor and two or three teaching assistants. Having gone through the bootcamp myself, I feel the teaching assistants play an incredibly important role because they provide valuable assistance throughout the whole bootcamp.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will the curriculum at Ironhack Berlin be the same as other Ironhack campuses?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ironhack’s current curriculum is divided into three modules: Front-end (HTML, CSS &amp; Javascript), Backend MEAN Stack, and Microservices with Angular 2 (API’s). We are always looking to make our curriculum better. We were teaching Ruby on Rails, but we decided to move on to . Also, something I always tell prospective students is that you learn how to learn. I graduated from the Ruby on Rails course and was able to learn Node.js on my own just the next month.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're in contact with a lot of startups, so we make sure our curriculum is exactly what employers need and demand. We make a point to keep the curriculum consistent across all campuses. This allows us to have a feedback loop at every campus and ensure consistent quality. So we’re sticking with the same curriculum in every campus for now, but always looking to iterate and make it better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tell us about the Berlin campus. What is the classroom like?\n",
      "\n",
      "As with most of our new campuses, we'll be located at a WeWork co-working space, a new building called Atrium Tower right on Potsdamer Platz. The space itself is a big room which holds around 40 students. When we visited the space about a month and a half ago, we fell in love with the facilities. The campus is accessible from anywhere in town because of its central location, and it has an incredible terrace at the top.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you're going to be learning for three months in an incredibly intense program, being in a nice space with amenities – coffee, snacks, really nice views – is something really important.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are some examples of the types of jobs you envision your Berlin graduates landing after bootcamp?\n",
      "\n",
      "We have a very strong reputation worldwide, with a global community of alumni and partners. For example, we just signed up N26, a mobile bank to be our hiring partner. We’re in talks with several Berlin companies to sign them up as hiring partners too. At the end of each nine-week course, we prepare prospective employers to meet with the students. Like I said, we're very focused on career changers and ensuring our students get a job within three months after graduation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past, we've had companies like Google, Twitter, Visa, Rocket Internet, and Magic Leap hire Ironhack graduates. So in Berlin we're looking for the same profiles. Those are global companies we already have partnerships with, so our students already have access to that pool of employers. Then locally, we are looking for the most disruptive companies that are ready to hire entry-level junior developers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you envision Berlin grads staying in Berlin? Is your focus to get people hired in the city where they studied?\n",
      "\n",
      "We have a big focus on having a global community. So we really like the idea that our students can access all the communities in all our cities. For example, I recently passed on the resumes of two graduates from the Madrid UX/UI course to Berlin-based N26. It’s up to each graduate to decide which city to work in.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lot of people want to stay in their home city and others don't, so we cater to both. We try to give opportunities to go abroad, and options to work in the local market.\n",
      "\n",
      "What would you recommend a complete beginner do to learn more about the tech scene in Berlin?\n",
      "\n",
      "I would recommend going to as many meetups and events as you can. I always tell people that you never know what opportunities could arise if you put yourself out there, and start talking to people. We actually just wrote a blog post about How to Land the Tech Job in Berlin, and one piece of advice is to mingle. Just network.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, of course, I would recommend going to the Ironhack meetups. There are a bunch of workshops in Berlin and our informal network is huge. We're doing one free workshop every week and we'll do some bigger events as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "What advice do you have for someone who's thinking about attending a coding bootcamp in Berlin and considering Ironhack?\n",
      "\n",
      "Form my experience as an alum, I think it's all about the attitude. When you go into a coding bootcamp, there's always this feeling where you're a little bit scared because it is something really demanding. People have a natural tendency to be resistant to learn something so technical. But just start coding! It's not as difficult as it may seem, and having the right guidance is key. We’re actually launching a cool challenge in Berlin - a free online course to encourage people to get their feet wet with coding.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lot more people than we believe have the aptitude for it, and actually become really good programmers. You just have to take a leap of faith and commit to three months of very intense work. We have a 90% placement rate and while we do have a rigorous admissions process, the majority of our students get hired. I recommend people to just go for it. I can guarantee that if you have the right attitude, you'll succeed.\n",

I was Head of Operations in North Africa and then Managing Director of Tunisia.I got in touch with Ariel and Gonzalo, the founders of Ironhack, and was really inspired by their vision. Also, since I actually attended a coding bootcamp myself, I was excited to come and work in this industry. I saw the great potential the bootcamp model had in Europe and also Latin America. I was keen to have an impact on people’s lives, so I was super receptive to our conversation and working with Ironhack. It was a great fit.\n",

      "There are three main areas to consider when launching in a new market. The first is human resources – we want to build an awesome team including a general manager. We were super excited to find a great GM for our Mexico campus. Marketing and brand awareness is number two. When you're launching in a new market, you want to increase the brand awareness and convince your first students of the benefits of the new campus. It can be difficult in a new market because we are starting from scratch, so we have to leverage the use of marketing channels such as public relations, events, and partnerships to integrate ourselves into the local ecosystem. The third area is legal – making sure the legal administration is completed. If you succeed in those three areas, you are ready to open in any market.\n",
      "\n",
      "What stood out about Mexico City? Why did Ironhack choose to open a campus there?\n",
      "\n",
      "We are one of the leaders in the coding bootcamp industry globally, and we’ve been thinking about opening in Latin America for quite some time. Latin America is a great market because there is so much demand for tech skills, but there is a limited number of established bootcamps in the area. In 2019 it is estimated there will be a deficit of 150,000 IT jobs in Mexico, so we can have a great impact on that. We want to train the new generation of technology professionals to join the industry. Not many, if any, bootcamps have campuses in the U.S., Europe, and in Latin America, so Latin America was very attractive to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mexico City was the preferred choice because it has a booming tech ecosystem. It's one of the largest markets for startups. Mexico City is the entry for many tech companies moving to Latin America – Facebook, Amazon, and so on – so many tech multinationals are moving in.  The ecosystem is not just booming, it's also maturing significantly well as there are plenty of VC’s, accelerators, and company builders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, it's a pretty friendly environment for internet technology and computer science. It's a big market to penetrate, but it's less difficult than some other markets because there are no global competitors. There are obviously some local competitors, whom we respect a lot, but we are going to give the Mexico City ecosystem access to Ironhack’s global community which is already present in Miami, Paris, Barcelona, and Madrid. We think building ties within those markets will excite students learning in Mexico City.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are only a few bootcamps in Mexico City. How will Ironhack stand out once other bootcamps start to pop up?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ironhack will stand out because we are global. We have already learned so much about running a bootcamp, because each market we operate in has different standards and different challenges. So by bringing this experience into the market, we are raising the coding bootcamp standards for Mexico City. Ironhack has graduated 1,000 students, so we have a large community. We have alumni working for Amazon, Google, and IBM, which is a big plus. We have great reviews on Course Report, and we have great student satisfaction for our curriculum. Over the four years we have been operating, we have continued to improve our teaching methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the Ironhack Mexico City campus like?\n",
      "\n",
      "Our offices are at the WeWork Insurgentes coworking space, and it's amazing to work alongside different Mexico City startups and see how dynamic the space is. It’s super exciting. We’re in the Colonia Napoles, which is like a district of startups. At WeWork we take up two rooms of 20 x 30 feet each which hold between 15 to 20 students. We will start with one class, and then eventually have two classes rolling at the same time – one UX/UI design course, and one web development course.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our objective at Ironhack is not quantitative, it's more qualitative so we are not going to accept students if they don't have the required technical level. We are selective with students and we don't accept everyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Could you describe the Ironhack application process? Is it the same across campuses?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. We have two interviews – one personal interview and one technical interview. You can make it through the technical interview even if you don't have tons of knowledge, but you must be a hard worker. If you prepare your case, you can make it in, but we want to be selective.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the bootcamp starts we also have pre-work and the objective is to have everyone at the same knowledge level when we start the course. People are spending a lot of time and money to really improve, so the courses are very intensive for that reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ironhack teaches UX/UI design and web development. Will you be teaching the same curriculum in Mexico City?\n",
      "\n",
      "We collect feedback in each market, and with each piece of feedback we receive, we improve our curriculum little by little. We trust and use the same curriculum in every market. You can’t scale efficiently if you have each market doing different classes. The feedback loops in all the different markets allow us to have the best quality program. I don’t think we could have the best quality if we made too many specificities for the various cities.\n",
      "\n",
      "How many instructors will you have at the Mexico City campus?\n",
      "\n",
      "The number of instructors will grow as the number of students and the number of classes increase. For instance, at the Paris campus, four months after launching we had seven teachers. It will be the same for Mexico. So we’ll start with one instructor and then after a few months, seven, and after one year maybe 10 – we're going to see how fast it grows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Ironhack is a global bootcamp, how do you help with the job search and placement? What sort of jobs do you expect graduates to get?\n",
      "\n",
      "We are trying to build partnerships with Linio, TIP, and many Mexican startups where we can place our students. Companies will be invited to Hiring Week at the end of the bootcamp to see what type of talent we produce. We’ll start by targeting companies in Mexico City and then we’ll expand and make partnerships with companies in Guadalajara and Monterrey as a second step.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of our graduates become junior developers. We have less entrepreneurs and more junior developers. Ironhack focuses on career changers and trying to help them to achieve their ambitions so that’s why we are so focused on placement with Iron Week, and a placement manager in each market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is it pretty normal for graduates to stay in the city where they studied?\n",
      "\n",
      "We are seeing graduates stay in the city where they studied, unless they’re coming from abroad. We have a few international students and currently, most of them go to the Barcelona and Paris campuses. We don't know about Mexico City graduates yet, but most of our applications so far are from Mexico – with some international applicants as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "If someone is a beginner and thinking about attending a coding bootcamp in Mexico City like Ironhack, do you have any meetup or event suggestions?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, Ironhack is doing a huge full-day event at WeWork on December 9th. Anyone can attend and it’s free. This is a great opportunity to learn about tech, discover the Mexico City ecosystem and decide if you want to apply to Ironhack.\n",
      "\n",
      "What advice do you have for people thinking about attending a coding bootcamp like Ironhack?\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing is, it’s an amazing commitment, and if you are applying for good reasons and have the technical ability, you will be accepted and get the best experience. It's a once in a lifetime experience to spend nine weeks changing your career. You will learn so much, meet new companies, and get hired. If you want to learn more, go to the Ironhack website, download the application guide, and come to some events. We have a Meetup group and Facebook page. You can read plenty of reviews of the school on Course Report. If you are sure of your motivations, you are a hard worker, and you’re committed, I'm sure you will be accepted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you have any additional comments about the Ironhack’s new Mexico City campus?\n",
      "\n",
      "We are very excited about having an amazing team at WeWork in Mexico City. We are at the center of the startup ecosystem so I think it will be an amazing experience for our students.\n",

      "Ironhack is a global web development bootcamp with locations in Madrid, Miami, Barcelona, and now Paris! We spoke with Ironhack’s General Manager for France, François Fillette, to learn more about their new Paris campus, launching June 26th. France is the second largest tech ecosystem in Europe – learn why Ironhack chose to expand to the area, read how the bootcamp will stand out from the rest, and see what resources are available to become a successful bootcamp grad in Paris.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, as the France General Manager, tell me how you’ve been involved with the new Ironhack campus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure! As a General Manager, I have been involved in all the dimensions related to the new campus – finding an amazing place for our students, recruiting a team of A-players, setting up the docs and processes and so on. I have been working with Alex, our Head of International Expansion, who has been tremendously helpful. We have worked super hard over the last few weeks to make sure that our Paris campus will be on the same standards as the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s your background and how did you get involved with bootcamps? What drew you to want to work with Ironhack?\n",
      "\n",
      "I was coming back from San Francisco, where I was working as VP of Strategy and Business Development for CodinGame. One of my VC friends told me that Ariel and Gonzalo (the cofounders) were looking for someone to launch Ironhack in France. I met the two of them and immediately embraced their vision, and got impressed by their ability to execute fast and well. I got super excited by the project and the team, so a couple of days later I was in Miami to work on the strategy and the launch plan for France! It’s been 3 months now and honestly, I’ve never been happier to wake up in the morning and start a new day!\n",
      "\n",
      "Ironhack is launching their Paris campus on June 26th. Why is Paris a great place for a coding bootcamp? Could you explain Ironhack’s motivation to expand there?\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of funding, France is now the 2nd largest tech ecosystem in Europe, right after England. Over the last 5 years, it has grown exponentially and is now one of the key tech hubs in the world. Take Station F for instance – thanks to Xavier Niel (cofounder of Free), Paris will now have the biggest incubator in the world. That growth has fueled an increasing demand for new skills in the tech economy and the talent shortage is not filled by the traditional education players. There’s an amazing opportunity for us to expand here and we’ll do everything we can to reach our targets.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a few other coding bootcamps in Paris. What will make Ironhack stand out amongst the competition?\n",
      "\n",
      "Several initiatives and players have appeared over the last couple of years, which shows you how dynamic the market is. I think 3 elements will set Ironhack apart from the competition. First, our courses are focused on the latest technologies – for example, full-stack Javascript for Web Development – and we constantly iterate to improve both the content and the academic experience. Then, we dedicate a large share of the course (60-70%) to hands-on, real-life applications. Students work on real projects, submitted by partners or by themselves if they want to create their startup/business. Last, we help with the placement of our students if they’re looking for a job (coaching for technical and behavioral interviews, connections to companies/startups, events, etc.). We have an average placement rate of 90% after 3 months across our campuses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s discuss the Paris campus. What is the classroom like? What neighborhood is it in?\n",
      "\n",
      "The campus is located in the new space opened by WeWork. It is located in the 9th arrondissement, near the Paris Opera. It is accessible via 3 metro lines, 8 bus lines, 2 bike-sharing stations, and 2 car-sharing stations. It will be open 24/7 for our students.\n",
      "\n",
      "The place is absolutely magnificent, both in terms of design and community. Students will enjoy a large classroom close to the patio, and meeting/working rooms to complete their projects and assignments.\n",
      "\n",
      "What web development and UX/UI design tracks or languages are you teaching at this campus and why? Are the ones you’ve chosen particularly popular or relevant in Paris?\n",
      "\n",
      "The core curriculum is the same across the different campuses to make sure students have the same academic experience and that we have a strong expertise in our area. Then we tailor the mentors, the events and the projects to the local specificities of the students and of the ecosystem. So, for Web Development, we’ll be focusing on full-stack Javascript but we’ll be integrating events and mentors around frameworks really popular here (ex: React or Meteor) and industries that are the rising trends (ex: online media and entertainment).\n",
      "\n",
      "How many instructors and/or mentors will you have in Paris?\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ll have a lead instructor, who is a professional developer and highly involved in the open source community. He has several years of experience in startups and IT services agencies. He’ll be assisted by a TA, who is a bit more junior, but passionate about education and teaching students. Plus, we’ll have a network of 15-20 mentors to help and coach students, for coding as well as for management. Mentors will be chosen based on the projects of the students. Also, the students of the first Web Development session will be sponsored by Florian Jourda. Florian was the 1st engineer at Box and scaled their dev team from 2 to 300 people. He spent 8 years in the Silicon Valley and is now Chief Product Officer at Bayes Impact, an NGO funded by Google that uses machine learning to solve social problems like unemployment.\n",
      "\n",
      "How many students do you usually have in a cohort? How many can you accommodate?\n",
      "\n",
      "For that first cohort, we plan to have 20 students maximum because we want to make sure we provide the best experience. That will ensure a strong monitoring of students, as well as a perfect operational execution on our side. For the next cohorts, we’ll increase the number of students, but we won’t go above 30 and we’ll recruit 1 or 2 more TAs to keep the same quality.  \n",
      "\n",
      "What kind of hours will students need to put in to be successful?\n",
      "\n",
      "Students often ask that question and it’s always hard to answer. Everything depends on their learning curve. On average, students work between 50 to 70 hours a week, mainly on projects and assignments. But we’re fully transparent on this – you can’t learn real hard skills and get a job in 3 months without fully dedicating yourself. We make sure that the atmosphere is as good as it can be so that students won’t see time passing by!\n",
      "\n",
      "How is your campus similar or different to the other Ironhack campuses?\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that our campus is pretty similar to Miami’s. We are located in an amazing coworking space, in a very nice neighborhood and with lots of startups around. The main difference would be our rooftop on the 8th floor of the building, where we regularly organize events and lunches.\n",
      "\n",
      "How are you approaching job placement in a new city? Does Ironhack have an employer network already?\n",
      "\n",
      "Job placement is one of the elements we tailor to the local realities and needs. We have already partnered with +20 tech companies, such as Drivy (world leader in peer-to-peer car rental), Jumia (the equivalent of Amazon in Africa and Middle East), Stootie (Europe leader in peer-to-peer services), Kima Ventures (VC fund of Xavier Niel, with +400 portfolio companies), etc. Usually, they are large startups (from Series A to Series D) looking to hire web developers. As a GM, it will be part of my job to support and help students accomplish their professional projects with our employer partners.\n",
      "\n",
      "What types of companies are hiring developers in Paris and why types of companies do you expect to hire from Ironhack’s Paris campus?\n",
      "\n",
      "I think there are 3 types of companies that could hire web developers who graduated from Ironhack – corporations in Telecom/Media/Technology, startups (from Series A to series D) and IT services companies. The demand is really intense for the last two options, as they’re looking for people mastering the latest technologies, in high volumes. Based on the enthusiasm they’ve expressed when talking with Ironhack, we know they’ll be great recruiting partners.  \n",
      "\n",
      "What sort of jobs have you seen graduates get at other Ironhack campuses and what do you expect for Ironhack Paris graduates? Do they usually stay in the city after graduation?\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the metrics of other campuses, usually, 50-60% of people join a startup as an employee (a Junior Web Developer, Project Manager or Growth Hacker). 20-30% create their own startup after the course, while 20-30% become freelancers, usually in Web Development, and work on a remote basis. We’ll have a good share of students who are not from France originally, so we think some of them might leave Paris after the course. But we’ll help them find the right opportunity abroad and we’ll keep constant interaction with those students.\n",
      "\n",
      "What meetups or resources would you recommend for a complete beginner in Paris who wants to get started?\n",
      "\n",
      "France has some great players in the field. If you want to get an intro to Javascript, I would recommend you visit OpenClassrooms, Codecademy or CodeCombat. Then, in terms of meetups, The Family and NUMA are two accelerators with outstanding weekly events. Some of them are related to one specific coding topic and they’re usually apprehended at a beginner level.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any final thoughts that you’d like our readers to know about Ironhack Paris?\n",
      "\n",
      "We want to build something that is nothing like what exists in Paris. In 3 months, you’ll be operational in Web Development, you’ll meet awesome people (students, mentors, entrepreneurs) and you’ll accomplish your professional project. Send us an email to know more at paris@ironhack.com. We have a few seats left for the session starting on June 26th. Next session will start on September 4th. If you want to apply, just send us your application through this typeform.\n",

      "Miami coding bootcamp Ironhack recently launched an intensive course in UX/UI Design, where students learn everything they need to know about user research, rapid prototyping, user testing, and front-end web development to land their first job in UX design. We sat down with instructor (and UX superstar) Jacqueline Pastore on their first day of class to find out what makes a great UX/UI Designer (think: listening skills, empathy and communication), how the school produces User Experience Unicorns by incorporating HTML/Bootstrap skills into the curriculum, and the teaching style that future students can expect at Ironhack Miami.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q&amp;A\n",
      "\n",
      "How did you become a successful UX Designer? Did you get a degree in “UX Design?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m a career changer! My background was first in film and creative writing, and I worked in the film industry in Miami before I ended up in Boston, temping as a project manager for a venture capital company with an incubator focused on Harvard and MIT startups. I learned from really smart people about computers, software, graphic design, and project management; and IBM had their Lotus Notes usability labs next door, so I got to participate as a usability tester. I went back to grad school at Bentley University for my Masters in Human Factors in Information Design, and had a magical career doing ethnography and user research at Microsoft, Staples, Adidas, and Reebok, and UX design for Fidelity Investments, Staples, the Federal Reserve, JP Morgan Chase, H&amp;R Block, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, and Zumba Fitness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two years ago, I moved back to Miami and started my own product, UX Gofer, which is a UX research tool.\n",
      "\n",
      "After spending years learning User Experience and even getting a Masters degree, why do you believe in the bootcamp model as an effective way to learn UX Design?\n",
      "\n",
      "I went through my grad program very quickly (in one year), so I believe that you can learn this material very quickly and then continue learning on the job. That’s exactly why I’ve had a successful career, by specifically going after different verticals, technologies, and platforms. If I hadn’t used something before, I wanted to try it. I believe that you can learn the fundamentals quickly and then refine them throughout your career.\n",
      "\n",
      "What made you excited to work at Ironhack in particular- what stands out about Ironhack to you as a professional UX Designer?\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the people. I was referred to Ironhack by someone I’ve respected in the industry for years, and they were right. The people running Ironhack are what convinced me to work on this UX Bootcamp.\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you have teaching experience prior to teaching at the bootcamp? What is different about teaching at a coding bootcamp?\n",

      "I teach now at the University of Miami, at conferences, and bootcamps. At Ironhack, my personal teaching style is to lecture very little, and focus on hands-on work. It’s important to know the foundations and principles and science behind what we do, but at the end of the day, you have to deliver. So we spend the majority of our days doing activities, which means running surveys, doing interviews, running usability tests, designing products. I think it’s so important for students to create their portfolio pieces throughout the bootcamp, instead of just having one portfolio project at the end of the course. For someone breaking into the UX community, the portfolio is how students demonstrate their knowledge and how they approach projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is Ironhack’s first foray into UX/UI design courses! Tell us about the curriculum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marcelo Paiva and I created the Ironhack curriculum based on what we would have wanted to learn in a bootcamp if we were to just get started in this field. We follow the user and product development lifecycles to make sure that our students have all the skills they need to be useful right now in the current marketplace.\n",
      "\n",
      "We start with user research – how to talk to your target market, the methodology behind that research, what to do with that data, deliverables, and turning that data into concept design.\n",
      "\n",
      "We move into information architecture and interaction design, with low-fidelity all the way into high-fidelity, and micro interaction models. We use Invision, Sketch, and Principal as the tools for that piece of the curriculum. Then we move into visual design for mobile and web, because they are two different beasts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we move into front-end development, where students learn how to implement the designs they’re creating. This is what the industry is looking for right now: the unicorns that can do the HTML and bootstrap to implement their own designs. That will make Ironhack students really effective and marketable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, we move into individual projects. Ironhack students are building portfolio pieces from Day One, but towards the end of the course, they work on more specific projects and breakouts for additional topics that we haven’t covered yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m so super excited about this bootcamp and I think it’s really valuable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is the push for designers to learn to code the biggest trend in the UX/UI field right now?\n",
      "\n",
      "It depends on where our graduates choose to work. As part of a smaller team, a UX Designer will have to be more of a generalist, and need to do research, design, and development. If they’re working for a larger organization, they can specialize in a particular field within UX like ethnography, or mobile design, or design thinking. As a whole, I think careers in the UX community are becoming both broader and more specialized. The UX community is both coming together and breaking into niches.\n",
      "\n",
      "How many instructors, TAs, and/or mentors do you have? Is there an ideal student:teacher ratio?\n",
      "\n",
      "The student:teacher ratio for the UX/UI course is 10:1. Many of the required activities are tackled in groups among the students in groups of 3 or 4. As the principal instructor, I lead and teach the main flow of the course, and we have subject matter experts and mentors come in to teach sections of the curriculum that are more specialized e.g. design thinking, front-end development, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can you tell us a little bit about the ideal student for Ironhack’s UX/UI Design Bootcamp? What’s your class like right now? And how do the UX students differ from the coding bootcamp students?\n",
      "\n",
      "The ideal student for the UX/UI Design Bootcamp is someone who possesses strong communication skills, can use empathy to jump into other people’s shoes, and has a passion for user-experience. The current class is a wonderful mix of many professional backgrounds: for example, some profiles include a former Marketing Manager for Sony Music, a Research Director from the non-profit space, and an MBA grad looking to use their previous Business Process skills to crack into the UX sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a full-time bootcamp, but how many hours a week do you expect your students to commit to Ironhack Miami?\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the daily schedule of 9am to 6pm, we expect students to spend approximately 20 hours outside of class time to work on assignments and projects- so about ~65 hours/week.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a UX bootcamp, is the style largely project based? Can you give us an example?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, students will work on 2 projects during the first 6 weeks (one individual project and one group project). These projects are a sum of the individual units we cover on a week-by-week basis. The capstone of the course is a 2-week final project that each student completes individually, as they go through the entire user and product development lifecycles. The result at the end of the course is that each student has 3 prototypes that they can use as portfolio pieces moving forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s the goal for a student that graduates from Ironhack (in terms of career and ability)? For example, will they be prepared for a junior UX/UI role? A senior role?\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal of this course is to provide students the skills to carry out a UX/UI design process from beginning to end in multiple circumstances with varying goals. As a result, students will be prepared for junior and entry-level roles in UX/UI fields, depending on which part of that process most interests them.\n",
      "\n",
      "For our readers who are beginners, what resources or meetups do you recommend for aspiring bootcampers in Miami?\n",
      "\n",
      "We hold open houses and free introductory workshops to coding and design monthly, which can be found on the Ironhack Meetup page. Our friends at IxDA also offer some cool workshops on Meetup.\n",
      "\n",

From students looking for free coding bootcamps to those wondering if an $18,000 bootcamp is worth it, we understand that cost is important to future bootcampers! While the average full-time programming bootcamp in the US costs $11,906, bootcamp tuition can range from $9,000 to $21,000, and some coding bootcamps have deferred tuition. So how do you decide what to budget for? Here, we break down the costs of coding bootcamps from around the USA. This is a cost comparison of full stack (front end and back end) in-person (on-site) immersive bootcamps that are nine weeks or longer, and many of them also include extra remote pre-work study. We have chosen courses which we think are comparable in course content – they all teach HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, plus back end languages or frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, Python, Angular, and Node.js. All schools listed here have at least one campus in the USA.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ironhack is an immersive iOS and Web Development bootcamp that started in Spain and has now expanded to Miami. With a hiring network and happy alumni, Ironhack is a great Florida bootcamp option. But what exactly does it take to get into Ironhack? We caught up with the Ironhack team to learn everything you need to know about the Ironhack application and interview process, including how long it will take, their current acceptance rate, and a sneak peek at the questions you'll hear in the interview. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Application\n",
      "\n",
      "How long does the Ironhack application typically take?\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ironhack application process falls into 3 stages (the written application, first interview, and second technical interview) and takes on average, 10-15 days to complete in entirety.\n",
      "\n",
      "What goes into the written application? Does Ironhack require a video submission?\n",
      "\n",
      "The written application is a chance for students to give a quick summary of their background and motivations for wanting to attend. It’s their opportunity to tell us about themselves in a nutshell and peak the admission committee’s interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "What types of backgrounds have successful Ironhack students had? Does everyone come from a technical background?\n",
      "\n",
      "We are impressed and inspired by the diversity of students that Ironhack attracts. We’ve had former flight attendants, world-travelling yoginis, and CS grads from Ivy Leagues all attend Ironhack. We’ve been amazed at how coding is so democratic and attracts all sorts of people, regardless of educational background or pedigree. Those who tend to perform the best at Ironhack are those who have committed to doing so, not necessarily those with a technical background.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Interview\n",
      "\n",
      "Can you give us a sample question from the “first interview?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What motivates you on a day-to-day basis and what do you love to do?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Can you give us a sample question from the “technical interview?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What happens when you put a function inside a loop?”\n",
      "\n",
      "What are a few resources that you suggest applicants use to really ace the technical interview?\n",
      "\n",
      "When an applicant is in the midst of our process, we actually send them materials specifically to prepare for the technical interview and set office hours with our Teaching Assistants, so they can get some one-on-one time to address specific questions. Apart from that, If they already have some experience programming: https://autotelicum.github.io/Smooth-CoffeeScript/literate/js-intro.html. We recommend this resource for complete beginners: JavaScript for Cats: http://jsforcats.com/\n",
      "\n",
      "How do you evaluate an applicant’s future potential? What qualities are you looking for?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ironhack’s application process reveals a lot of qualities in potential candidates because it is a bit longer than most coding schools. The advantage of this is, it allows us to see how candidates and applicants respond to learning material in a short amount of time, and how dedicated they are to their goals. If they can’t even complete the interview process, it’s an indicator that they might not have the passion or drive to get through 8 weeks of a coding bootcamp! We look for curiosity, passion, and drive. Drive is probably the most important quality to succeed at Ironhack.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there a technical coding challenge in the Ironhack Application?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes!\n",
      "\n",
      "How long should it take? Is there a time limit?\n",
      "\n",
      "We give our students exactly 7 days to prepare for the technical interview after the 1st interview and provide the materials they need to prep for it. The technical interview is led by one of our Miami instructors and consists of a coding challenge that the applicant has 30 minutes to solve.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can an applicant complete the coding challenge in any programming language?\n",
      "\n",
      "The applicant can complete the challenge in whatever programming language they feel most comfortable in as long as that language can solve a breadth of problems. That means that something like CSS is out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Getting Accepted\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the current acceptance rate at Ironhack?\n",
      "\n",
      "As of now, our current acceptance rate is ~20% (23.5%, to be exact!)\n",
      "\n",
      "Are students accepted on a rolling basis?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. Spots fill up quickly, so the sooner the applicant gets started, the better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Does Ironhack Miami have a lot of international students since your roots are in Spain? Do international students get student visas/tourist visas to do the program?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes! We have more than 25 countries represented in our bootcamps globally (e.g. Thailand, Pakistan, Germany, France, Brazil, etc.) The majority of our students who travel to Miami from abroad use a tourist visa to visit the US and attend our program. We love the melting pot of Miami combined with Ironhack’s reputation globally. It’s really a fun place to learn and study!\n",

      "There were many instructors, so trying to give feedback about all of them would be endless. The teaching style was agile, asking for feedback continuously and adapting the course to it, so it made the experience really enriching.

      "After working at an IT company managing programmers, Jaime Munoz decided that he wanted to learn coding skills, so he enrolled in IronHack, a coding bootcamp in Madrid (with locations in Miami and Barcelona). Jaime tells us why he chose IronHack, the technical and soft skills he learned in his course and the mentors who have helped him along the way.\n",

      " \n",
      "\n",
      "What were you up to before deciding to enroll in IronHack? Did you have a technical background before applying? \n",
      "\n",
      "​Before being a programmer​ I was Project Manager in a big IT company. I hired programmers, and managed their work. After some time I began to be more and more interested in the work those programmers were doing. So much that I decided to quit my job and learn to code. I did a Master's degree of 400 hours in CICE (a IT school in Madrid) with the great luck to have an amazing teacher called Devta Singh. I learned much more than just coding from him. He showed me how to face the problem, find the better solution, and how to succeed on it. It was a personal revelation, and since this moment I knew that I wanted to be a programmer. \n",
      "\n",
      "After the degree I started to work in a digital advertising company called The Fact. We worked for traditional offline advertising companies they needed digital development for his clients. I improved my php and javascript skills there during almost 2 years, but I had the feeling I wasn't improving faster enough. I tried to look for something new to stimulate myself and began to teach coding in a IT academy from Madrid called Trazos, but I needed a change to keep pushing my skills. That's why I turned to IronHack.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Was IronHack the only bootcamp you applied to? What about IronHack convinced you to go there (the languages they taught, instructors, price etc)? \n",
      "\n",
      "​IronHack was my first and last choice. Honestly, I didn't knew many bootcamps, but the main reason were the instructors and the great professionals they talked very good about the course. Many of the coders I admire like Keyvan Akbary or Carlos Blé were involved and interested on the bootcamp. This was enough to make the choice.​\n",

      "\n",
      "What were your classmates and instructors like?  \n",
      "\n",
      "​They were all amazing. I guess I was very very very lucky on that point, because all my classmates were amazing. Not only because they were friendly (they really were), but because they were skilled and interested to push like I was.\n",
      "It's amazing when you share such experience with people they think and like the same thinks like you, because it pushed the level very high.\n",
      "The instructors were also great. Very friendly and open to discuss or try whatever we asked for. I think they can't imagine how thankful I am.​ But not only with the teachers or students. Also with Ironhack's staff. They did everything possible to make us receive what we needed.\n",

I use PHP, MySQL, HTML5, LESS, Phinx, PHPActiveRecord, JavaScript and other technologies every day, but the key is that I'm not only a developer there.

      "​Maybe I could be able to learn the technical part, but there is no way to learn it in 2 months without a bootcamp. It's just too much information to handle it alone.​ Besides, there is much more than the technical knowledge that you receive in IronHack. You also get a lot of contacts, friends, experience, knowhow and the most important thing: a perspective of what you don't know yet.\n",

      "\n",
      "What were you up to before deciding to enroll in IronHack? Did you have a technical background before applying? \n",
      "\n",
      "When I decided to enroll in IronHack I had just finished my degrees in Software Engineering and Business Administration. When I finished my studies I realized that my background in mobile and web development was not enough, so I was looking for an opportunity in a company that would bet on me.  \n",
      "I'm a very motivated person and, in fact, I interviewed with companies like Google and IBM but I did not have enough experience. It was around that time that I found Ironhack bootcamp and I decided to try it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had technical background as a software engineer but most of my experience programming was based on languages such C, Java or SQL. I needed to improve my skills in order to become a better developer.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Was IronHack the only bootcamp you applied to? What about IronHack convinced you to go there?\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the only bootcamp I applied to and the main reason was that they were looking for people like me. Motivated people who had the drive to become a great professional and were only lacking the opportunity to show their potential. They train people in modern languages like Ruby. \n",
      "This was not only an awesome opportunity to learn Rails, but also to be in an environment that is difficult to find in other places. I was learning from the very best professionals and from an incredibly talented group of students.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Can you talk about a time when you got stuck in the class and how you pushed through?\n",
      "\n",
      "IronHack is an intensive bootcamp, you must be sure that you are able to push through any problem you have and my classmates were an important point to lean on. On one of my very first days at IronHack I was having trouble understanding one of the concepts that we were covering and it was through teamwork with my other classmates that we were all able to understand it.\n",
      "\n",
      "My classmates were as motivated as me so it was easy to find people to continue programming on weekends or after the class. It was great for me.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "What were your classmates and instructors like?  \n",
      "\n",
      "In this bootcamp I was surrounded by the very best professionals from all over the country, so I can only say that it was a pleasure to convert their knowledge into mine. Being able to share this experience with my classmates was awesome. If I could have the opportunity to do another Ironhack bootcamp it would be amazing. They are the fastest two months I've ever lived.  \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Tell us about your final project! What does it do, what technologies did you use, how long did it take, etc? \n",
      "\n",
      "Well, my final project was about a travel application. With this web application you were able to save, organize and share all your trip information. This project was developed in two weeks and in order to achieve all the features that I wanted to include on it, I used Rails. As I wanted to demonstrate all the things that I had learned in IronHack, I decided to include Responsive Web Design (using CSS3) and JavaScript, jQuery and HTML5 functionalities like geolocalization or web storage to improve the user experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of those two weeks I had a huge frontend project, which was more than I'd ever expected. Thanks to my hard work and efforts in this project I was one of the finalists in the Hackshow (the IronHack final show where the finalists can show what they have made in two weeks) and I could show my project to more than a hundred people.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "What are you working on now? Do you have a job as a developer? What does it entail?\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks to the Hackshow two days after the end of IronHack I was working at Floqq.com, the biggest online education marketplace in spanish all over the world. Nowadays, I'm frontend developer and product manager at Floqq.com and I'm working doing what I love to do.\n",
      "IronHack gave me the opportunity that other companies didn't give me. I had no experience and nobody wanted to hire me and now I'm still learning and improving my skills in the best place I could ever find.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Would you have been able to learn what you now know without IronHack? \n",
      "\n",
      "It would be impossible to learn what I've learned in IronHack in two months on my own. But it's not only about the development skills that I've improved in those two months, it´s also about the personal skills that I´ve been able to develop and the opportunity to meet the best IT professionals from all around Spain. IronHack was just a 180º experience that changed my whole life, and that allowed me to do what I believe I was born to do.\n",

      "Founder Spotlight: Ariel Quinones of IronHackLiz Eggleston4/21/2014Ironhack\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "IronHack is an 8-week coding bootcamp with campuses in Madrid, Barcelona, and soon, Miami! We talked with cofounder Ariel Quinones about their Rails curriculum, how they attract American students to \"study abroad\" in Spain, and what sets Ironhack apart. \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Tell us about how IronHack started.\n",
      "\n",
      "I come from a finance background- I’m originally from Puerto Rico, but spent 5 years in New York. My cofounder Gonzalo comes from the construction industry; he’s a civil engineer and he built all sorts of major infrastructure projects in Europe. Having said that, I come from a household of educators. Both of my parents were teachers when I was growing up and my father actually started a private university in Puerto Rico 20 years ago that started with 15 students and now they have 6 campuses and over 10,000 students enrolled.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think education was always a part of my DNA and I wanted to do something after completing my education. I met Gonzalo during our MBA; we were both at Wharton. He also wanted to do something in education in Europe and possibly in ed-tech as well. During those 2 years of the MBA we were iterating ideas, constantly and I think had the same issue that most non-technical founders have in the U.S., which is having brilliant “ideas” but once you get to the point where you need to execute them and produce an MVP, you’re not able to do it. It’s incredibly challenging to find a cofounder and it’s incredibly challenging from a cost and also from an operational perspective to outsource the development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gonzalo and I took a 2-day course at Wharton where they taught us to do very basic Rails. Even though we didn’t acquire the skills necessary to build our MVP, we were excited about the possibility of teaching both technical and non-technical people these skills through a highly intensive and compressed time period. After that experience, we started looking at the boot camp model. At that point, the earlier ones were starting to get a little bit of traction. We thought it would be interesting to do this somewhere abroad. I’d done a lot of business in Latin America so I had some ties to the region. Gonzalo, my partner is Spanish, so our first bet was Spain.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Would you say that IronHack is more geared towards makers or technical cofounders as opposed to people who want to get a job at an established company as a junior developer?\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve had both profiles. We’ve been selective in the people we admit from a technical background. We’ve been hesitant so far to say “go from total newbie to professional web developer in X weeks.” Our approach is appealing to folks that are maybe already in close touch with technology and code. Developers that want to professionalize their skills and take them to the next level, or people that are very smart, analytical and are looking for a hardcore experience that will allow them to learn from these types of people.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "When was the first cohort?\n",
      "\n",
      "The first cohort was in October of 2013. Each course is 8 weeks long.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "What was the biggest lesson that you learned after running your first cohort?\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing we learned is that the 8 weeks just fly by. When you plan for people to be coding 10 to 12 hours a day- that seems like a lot but every day goes by so quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other thing we learned was that no matter how much you filter to make sure you don’t have disparate levels prior to arriving, people just learn differently, at different velocities with different learning styles. So within the structure of 8 weeks we needed different exercises and flexibility to give people the chance to learn right at their own pace, while ensuring that everyone’s learning fundamentals.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Do you have students do pre-work before they get to IronHack?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, they do 100 hours of pre-work.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "What cities are you live in now?\n",
      "\n",
      "We’re live in Madrid and Barcelona and we’re launching in Miami in September.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Could you tell us about the tech scenes in the locations that you’re live in- Madrid and Barcelona?\n",
      "\n",
      "People love to come to Spain and study abroad. It’s a country that has a lot to offer from the lifestyle perspective; you know, you have great food, the parties… study abroad in Spain has been an integral part of Spanish society for many years, within the traditional higher education arena. In our case, we’re trying to position Spain in a similar fashion. In the first cohorts we trained a lot of people from Spain, but going forward we want to make it attractive for foreigners to come over and enjoy everything that Spain has to offer and at the same time, learn how to code.\n",
      "\n",
      "Barcelona is very exciting because you have people from all over the world that are launching startups there. Obviously within the EU there’s a lot of mobility; if you’re a European Union citizen, you can go anywhere without any sort of visa requirements. And I think a lot of northern Europeans and people from Germany for instance, love Barcelona for weather reasons, the great beaches, the lifestyle… so a lot of them are coming over to Barcelona to launch their own ventures here. In Barcelona, the tech ecosystem is thriving and it’s very international. There’s a lot of mobile startups that are getting traction over there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madrid is still very much a cosmopolitan city and we’re seeing a lot of traction in the startup space. It’s obviously an emerging ecosystem, nowhere near Silicon Valley, but we’re seeing early stage companies  get either acquired or go for substantial rounds of financing here in Madrid, which is ultimately a driver for our type of business. Companies need funding to employ engineers and we’re seeing that capital flow to early stage projects.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Do you get interest from people in the U.S.?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes; right now we’re getting a lot of interest from people all over the world, including the U.S. I interviewed a few candidates from the Northeast, we have another student from California who’s enrolling in our June course.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Is it possible for someone from the U.S. to complete IronHack and then work in Spain or in the EU?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, it’s definitely possible. It’s not as challenging as someone from Europe to go to the U.S. For sure, there’s still costs that the employer has to incur but it has nowhere near the costs and all the red tape that you have to deal with in the U.S.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Has IronHack raised any money?\n",
      "\n",
      "No, right now we’re bootstrapped and we want to keep it that way as long as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "So tell us what programming languages students are mastering at IronHack; tell us about the teaching style.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have two courses that are live right now: Web and Mobile.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Web course is an 8-week course. I’d say on average, students are with us in our offices 10 – 12 hours a day. We cover HTML, CSS and JavaScript on the front end, and then on the back we work with Ruby on Rails and teach a little bit of Sinatra as well. The first 6 weeks we’re teaching those core technologies. And the last 2 weeks, students are working on their own project from scratch. The culmination of the program is a demo day where they present their projects to the community- developers, startup cofounders, that type of audience.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’d say 90% of our content is practical. We’re big believers in the flipped classroom model, so we want to make sure that we reduce the amount of theory time to the extent possible. We get them all the resources, videos and exercises to complete at home prior to arriving here. While they’re here we give them homework and assignments for the weekend so we can reduce that theory time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The technology demands in Spain are very fragmented. It’s not like San Francisco where you can produce a gazillion Ruby on Rails grads every year and they’ll be hired by Rails startups. Here, we’re seeing some demand for Rails startups – but also Python, PHP, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Do you expect that after completing your course, a graduate would be able to learn Python or PHP on their own?\n",
      "\n",
      "A hundred percent, and we’re seeing that. Even though love the technologies we work with, we’re not obsessed with them either. To us they’re an instrument to teach good development practices. I think one thing that differentiates us from boot camps is our focus and obsession with good coding practices. We’re obsessed with testing, clean code and good design patterns. We’ve done our job if the student get a good background in technology but more importantly, take away those good coding practices that they apply to whatever language or framework they use.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Is the mobile class structured the same way?\n",
      "\n",
      "Same format, exact same structure; slightly higher requirements to be accepted. In order to be accepted into the mobile course, you already have to program with another object-oriented language. Our first course is focused on IOS development.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Do you think you’ll ever do an Android course?\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ll probably do Android in the near future.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "How many students do you have in each cohort?\n",
      "\n",
      "Right now we’ve capped at 20. We can probably go a bit more than that but we don’t want to do more than that.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "How many instructors do you have per class?\n",
      "\n",
      "We always like to have a ratio of at least 6 students per teacher. So when we have 15 students, we have one main professor and two teaching assistants. Our view is that if we’re going to teach you one technology, we want to make sure that the person that is instructing you is the best, most capable person and is highly specialized in that language.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "How have you found instructors?\n",
      "\n",
      "We went to the best companies here in Spain and other parts of Europe and basically found the best people there. They work part time for us. It’s very different to have someone who’s fulltime boot camp professor versus someone who is a developer and is teaching at a boot camp for 2 weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "And also from a recruiting perspective, a lot of our students have been hired by their teachers. Also, our students have a network that goes beyond their peers and the Ironhack staff; they have a network that connects to all these companies that these professors are coming from.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "You said that potential students should have some vested interest in programming and should have some background and be able to prove that they can really handle the material. What’s the application process?\n",
      "\n",
      "We have a 3-step application process. The first part is a written form that we screen and then we do two 30-minute Skype interviews. The first 30-minute Skype interview is to get a sense of who you are, why you want to do this, and get a sense of is you fit within our culture, and if you have that intrinsic motivation to make the most out of the 400 hours that you have here.\n",
      "\n",
      "We say “Listen; you’re going to be coding Monday through Friday, 10 hours a day and then you’re going to have work every day on Saturday/Sunday…” When I tell them that, we want someone who beams energy and positivity. If they make it through that interview, we have a second round, which is basically to assess technical skills. We’ve actually accepted a bunch of people that have never programmed before, but we want to make sure that you have the motivation and the analytical skill set to be able to catch up prior to arriving to our camp.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some cases, we have people that we think are very smart and incredibly motivated but have never coded in their lives, have never even worked with HTML. We admit them subject to another valuation post that second interview. So we’ll get them to complete 60 hours of pre-work and then see where they are.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "How does IronHack prepare your graduates to find jobs?\n",
      "\n",
      "The demo day is a great way to showcase our talent to our employers, and you have all sorts of employers there from the founding stage where they haven’t raised any money or are still pre-product, to tech employers who have technical teams and more than 30, 40 employees\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of the core curriculum we have speakers like employers come in during the 8 weeks to present their products and also it serves as an opportunity for them to get in touch with their students and identify potential hiring leads.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also bring in leading HR people from some of our top tech employers here to offer workshops on how to set up your CV, how to optimize your LinkedIn profile, SEO and all these things. And we coach them on how to conduct an interview. Right now we’ve had the luxury of being small so we’re all very involved in the process.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Are those companies paying a fee to get into the demo day or are they paying a recruiting fee once they’ve hired someone?\n",
      "\n",
      "Right now we’re not charging employers. We’re focused on placing 100% of our graduates and giving access to great companies (even those that wouldn’t be interested in paying a recruiting fee!).\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Have you been successful in placing your graduates?\n",
      "\n",
      "We’re starting to place a second cohort but in our first cohort, we placed nearly 100% percent of our graduates. I think in the first cohort we placed 60% of the people 3 week after the first course, and then the rest over the next 2 months.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Is the accreditation buzz that’s happening in California anywhere on your radar? Do you get any pressure from the government in Spain or are you thinking about going through the accreditation process when you expand to Miami?\n",
      "\n",
      "We’re definitely going to pay attention to this in Miami. We’re all for it if it helps the student, as long as it doesn’t interfere with the model and doesn’t limit the ability of these institutions to offer education that’s agile and that can adapt to the times and the technologies.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Are you planning on expanding beyond Miami anytime soon?\n",
      "\n",
      "I think for the next year or even beyond that, we’re going to focus on Miami and Spain. However, we’re going to use Miami and Spain as hubs for other regions. We’re getting a lot of interest from Latin American Students to come to Spain, so for those who would rather come to Miami because it’s closer, we can offer that as well.\n",
