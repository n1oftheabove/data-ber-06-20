# Ironhack Data Analytics Labs

## Working on the Assignments

**To work on your first assignment**, create a branch of your own with your name (change the branch name unless your name is Jenny Doe):

```
$ git checkout -b jenny-doe
```

Each project/lab has its own directory in which you'll find a `README.md` file and a sub-directory named `your-code`. The descriptions and requirements of the assignment can be found in the README file. When you work on the assignment, create your code files in the `your-code` directory and save regularly while you work.

After you finish, add those files to git, commit, and push your branch to GitHub. In the commit message, specify which lab/project you are submitting. For example:

```
$ git add <files-to-add>
$ git commit -m "Module 1 MySQL project"
$ git push origin jenny-doe
```

**To work on the subsequent assignments**, keep using the same branch you created and push your new codes to GitHub.

:exclamation: Update your branch regularly because the curriculum development team is developing new assignments for you as the course proceeds. Make sure you have committed all your codes then exectue `git pull origin master` to obtain the latest code from the `master` branch.

### Happy coding!
